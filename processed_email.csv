I spoke to Duran this morning, and he and I would like to meet together with 
us to discuss the Midway project and whether or not we will be able to 
utilize TurboPark Phase 2. I previously told him that because of timing 
considerations and because there may be certain agreements that will be 
difficult to make TurboPark compliant (such as the attached interconnect 
agreement from FPL), that Phase 2 may not be practical for purposes of this 
project.

I think this would be a good discussion to have on Friday, because we should 
have more information on the GE7FAs and should have already spoken with TECO 
on their proposed MOU (and maybe even the tolling agreement). What are your 
schedules on Friday?

I also would like to schedule a call for tomorrow with TECO to go over the 
MOU. Fred - Please coordinate with Kay and schedule something with Becky 
Alex. I would prefer the afternoon if that's OK with you guys, and would like 
45 min. before the call for us to meet seperately. Also Fred, please advise 
on the status of the tolling agreement.

Kay - attached is FPL's standard form interconnect agreement. I was thinking 
that Carlos would be a good choice to review it as he is currently working 
with accounting / finance on an Ameren interconnect, so he will already be 
familiar with the likely issues. Please let me know what you think. It will 
be important to give Duran a summary of likely accounting / finance issues 
related to this agreement on Friday. 

Hope you both had good weekends.

Highlights of This Issue

Governor Gray Davis of California met with a group of sell-side and rating
agency analysts in New York yesterday.  The Governor outlined his plan for
restoring the utilities to financial viability so that they can meet their
obligations.  Below we summarize a few highlights from the meeting.

Trying to Fit Solution Within Existing Rate Structure

The Governor talked about the need to find a solution to the utilities'
problems within the context of their existing rate structures. He indicated
that the temporary 9% rate hike from January 2000 would be made permanent and
that a 10% rate reduction that went into effect in January 1998 would be
reversed in March 2002.

Status of Negotiations with PG&E

As we noted in a February 26(**th) comment, the Governor has reached an
agreement in principle with Southern California Edison (EIX: B3/CC) to address
that utility's past under-collections.  He hopes to also have an agreement 
with
PG&E within the next 30 days, suggesting that progress was made in particular
in the last 2-3 days.  However, the Governor acknowledged that reaching an
agreement with PG&E was more difficult due to its larger under-collected
balance and lower rates compared with SCE.

Some Generators Agree to Haircut

The Governor indicated that a couple of unnamed generators have voluntarily
agreed to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for their past due
receivables. When pressed about which parties they've had constructive
discussions with, he identified Williams (WMB: Baa2/BBB-), Enron (ENE:
Baa1/BBB+) and Dynegy (DYN: Baa2/BBB+).  We note that most of the generators
and marketers with exposure to California have established reserves against
possible losses.  Importantly, the Governor said that he hoped that the banks
and bondholders would not be asked to take a haircut.

Prospects for Legislation and Possibility of Ballot Initiative

The Governor said he is quite confident that he can reach an agreement with 
the
utilities that the legislature can support.  Although he admitted that he
couldn't prevent someone from proposing a ballot initiative, the governor said
that in the end, the acid test with the public is how it affects their pocket
books.  Thus, if there is ultimately a ballot initiative, Governor Davis is
optimistic that the public will be supportive of his plan given the limited
impact on electric rates.

Status of Defaulted Utility Debt

As we have commented in the past, it appears unlikely that the resulting
legislation will pass with the required 2/3majority to go into effect
immediately.  Accordingly, there will be a several month lag before the
utilities receive any cash.  In response to a question, it appears that the
state will not step in to help the utilities pay off any maturing or defaulted
commercial paper.  But the Governor and his advisers hope that legislation 
will
provide enough certainty so that the companies can get bridge financing.
Essentially, it appears the Governor is leaving it up to the utilities to find
the money from their banks.

Governor's Strategy to Keep the Lights On

The Governor stated that a key reason that deregulation failed in California
was that no new power plants were built in the state for over twelve years.  
In
the intervening time, demand caught up with supply.  In response, he has
proposed various conservation initiatives and is trying to expedite the
construction of new power plants.  He set a goal of having 20,000 megawatts
(mws) of new supply on line by 2004.

In addition, the governor highlighted the need for additional investment in 
the
transmission infrastructure.  In particular, he cited the need to expand the
capacity to import more power from Arizona as well to improve the ability to
move power from south to north within the state. He suggested that part of the
rationale for the state taking over the utilities' transmission grids was to
ensure that the additional investment takes place.  He also suggested that the
state would lease the transmission lines back to the utilities to allow them 
to
continue to operate them.

In the meantime, the focus is to move away from California's over-reliance on
the spot market.  In that vein, Calpine (CPN: Ba1/BB+) yesterday announced the
signing of two long-term contracts with the state's Department of Water
Resources (DWR).  One of those contracts was to sell up to 1,000 mws over a 
ten-
year term.  The other was to provide up to 495 mw of peaking capacity under a
20-year contract.  Earlier in February, CPN had reached agreement with the DWR
on a separate 10-year contract for an additional 1,000 mws.

This is a second  tanker on which very few details
are available . The LNG group is working as we speak
to provide some information for Joe Sutton before
his departure for Paris this (Tuesday) afternoon.
There is no DASH on this 2nd tanker yet. I asked Dave Gorte
on Monday to send me one and was not told that
he can provide me with the Mystic Lady DASH as  the closest
substitute.

Vince - thanks for the update.  What I am not sure of is what if any decision 
has to be
made on May 19.  It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals 
have already
been approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or 
two.

Subject: Re: LNG May 19 decision  

John,

This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.

1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH 
and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the 
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island 
project (please, see point 2).

2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest 
(Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island 
transaction. The next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is 
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.

A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:

a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island 
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term
contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.

The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the 
long-term
contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are 
setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal 
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and 
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.

b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension 
option of
5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we
have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for 
such a long tenor. This is  
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread 
and
I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.

One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the 
first
5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.

c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a 
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market.

d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island 
deal
(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.
Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail 
that 
correlates very well with Brent.

I haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  
Anyway with Greg moving to his
new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the 
Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.

I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for 
LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand
that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far 
away).  Anway I understand this
is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you 
please let me know where you stand now?

I will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in 
the next couple of days and if you
have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.

Look forward to connecting with you Vince.

Since we have meters (Phillips Production meters) in the pool, if PNG will 
allow, it may be best to transfer the pool to ENA's name.  If the CES pool 
has to be closed, Phillips Production will have to sign documents to move 
meters from pool to pool.  I'm not sure what the lead time is to move meters.


If you are going to nom 430 Dth/Day, Heidi needs to nom Phillips Production @ 
9,058 Mcf/Month (9,058 * 1.03 = 9,330 dth) plus Power Gas 4,000 Dth/month.

Is Clinton going to take the PNG throug the end of the contracts?  Power Gas 
expires 10/31, Phillips expires 11/30.

Subject: EOG for July, Peoples

ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio 
(10,000/month)  to EES for the month of July.  EES has the ability to take 
this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would 
talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from 
Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks 
like this pool can be terminated.

Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi 
is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was 
terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may 
need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in 
August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer 
any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this 
after the 4th.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Hi Kay.  Thanks for this input.  My somewhat knee-jerk reaction has been that 
NEPCo is, indeed, taking a very aggressive approach.  We are also hearing 
that they are under some sort of ""mandate"" to include these provisions in 
their contracts on a going forward basis (I think I might have some idea of 
what that's about), but we are obviously concerned that it won't fly with a 
third party buyer of our project.  Dean, Jim Fowler (our outside counsel at 
McCutchen) and I may want to chat about it with you further.

On a related note, I keep running into the need to have a more basic 
understanding of the West LB documents and the GE LM-6000 contract than I 
have.  Do you have copies of those documents, and could I ask you to have 
copies made and sent to me?  Much appreciated.

Hope all is well,

NEPCO's position sounds more typical for a cost plus contract.  Is this a 
lump sum deal? If so, then I think NEPCO is taking an aggressive approach to 
both LOL and retention.  A 10% limit of liability during the warranty period 
is particularly aggressive, unless there are a lot of carve outs to the limit 
of liability, and other give-and-takes which make it make sense. Another 
factor which might make a difference is the treatment given to the GE 
contract.  Is NEPCO taking risk on GE performance, and is the dollar value of 
the GE equipment included in the price used to figure the % of liability?

I'm glad to discuss this if I can be of help.

Subject: EPC Limits of Liability

Kay - Ron Coker in the CTG group suggested you might be able to help with 
this.

ENA/SF is in the middle of negotiating the EPC contract for Pastoria (750 MW) 
with NEPCO.  We have hit a couple of snags in the contract and would very 
much appreciate your input as to what is ""market."" 

1. Limit of Liability -  NEPCO would like 80% up to Substantial Completion, 
40% up to Final Acceptance, and 10% for the Warranty Period.  GE's LOL is 
100% of their contract value though the warranty period. (which Kiewit also 
agreed to on Pittsburg.)
2. Retention - NEPCO would like to have 10% retention on payments only for 
the first 5% on the contract value and then 5% retention thereafter.  We 
would prefer 10% throughout the payment schedule.

What do you think?  We want the Owner's position to be as strong as possible 
to enhance the sale of the project, but NEPCO is under a great amount of 
pressure to reduce their contingent liability, and we really don't want to 
leave them holding the bag once we are gone if it is not necessary.

Fletcher Challenge, with respect to the acquisition of Fletcher Challenge by 
Shell Overseas Holdings Limited, and Shell's proposed subsequent assignment 
of the Fletcher Challenge Canadian nat gas trades to Apache Corporation.  I 
am sending copies of this letter to Russell Diamond, Mary Cook, Greg Johnston 
& Joe Hunter.

 Russell, I need to know if we would agree to the assignment of the trades to 
Apache. 

Russell, Mary:   With respect to such assignment, we have an old ERMS ISDA 
Local Currency Master Agreement in place.  Do we want to continue to transact 
w/Apache under this master, or use this as leverage to get a revised ISDA 
master in place?  Among the issues I quickly spotted in the Apache master 
were:

1.  It's a Local Currency Form, so we cannot transact cross border/cross 
currency products under it
2.  We have a 3rd Party Cross Default to Enron Corp. of $25,000,000
3.  We've got market quotation instead of loss for terminations
4.  No arbitration language
5.  Hard to believe, but we've made no choice of law election (maybe I'm 
blind)
6.  Don't have trade option rep (which probably doesn't matter anymore)
7.  ISDA Defintions refer to 1987 Interest Rate & Currency Exchange 
Agreement-time to update
8.  Setoff language old and doesn't have affiliate language in it
9.  Market Disruption Events not standard
10.  Old ""ERMS"" Collateral Annex
11.  $10,000,000 Exposure Threshold-is this sufficient all this business?
12.  Credit Event Upon Merger triggers -0- threshold
13.  LC Only Annex - really old LC language/forms everywhere

Joe Hunter, I am going to send you down the letter which has what they 
believe to be all the Fletcher Challenge trades listed.  Do we agree?

As usual, they would appreciate a prompt response so they can get this 
assignment completed.  Thanks you all for your help!",ECC/Fletcher Challenge Acquisition/Assignment

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 51/2000




Highlight

The cape market continues on its downward momentum with this time bunkers ( 
Fuel Oil ) helping the slide as they have lost approx. $30 in the last couple 
weeks and make the costs of running the ships significantly less.  Panamaxes 
have on the other hand, started a slow upward trend.  Most bundits think that 
this latest rise might be the 'dead cat bounce'.  The Japanese buyers and the 
US exporters of grain had stopped shipping grains over the last few weeks 
while arguing over 'starlink' which is basically genetically modified crops 
while all the panamaxes were getting stuck in the US gulf awaiting the news 
of resumed shipping.  When the US and Japan settled their dispute last week, 
Shipments of grain to Japan immediately resumed, and the panamax market 
quickly reversed trend and starting going up.  

With the Christmas season quickly approaching, we expect the market to slow 
down dramatically with owners and charterers wanting to fix their remaining 
positions quickly.   This is the last report in 2000.  Have a good holiday 
and see you next year !!!

 NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : November 30, 2000

EIA Rolls Out Long List of New Gas-Fired Power 
Between 2000 and 2004, a total of 145,417 MW of nonutility generation is 
expected to be added to the U.S. power grid and 83% of that total will be 
gas-fired power generation, according to a new survey by the Energy 
Information Administration. 

The EIA's Inventory of Nonutility Electric Power Plants in the United States 
find that a total of 799 new gas-fired units, totaling 120,645 MW in 
nameplate capacity, are scheduled to be added by the end of 2004.  The 
Southeastern Electric Reliability Council is expected to receive the largest 
portion of new nonutility generation with an additional 252 units totaling 
36,636 MW.  SERC is followed by ERCOT with 109 new units totaling 21,775 MW, 
ECAR with an expected 181 additional units totaling 17,733 MW and MAIN with 
140 new units totaling 17,139 MW. 

The largest amount of new nonutility capacity, or about 61,823 MW, is 
expected to be added in 2002.  About 46,551 MW of new capacity is scheduled 
to be in service next year. 

Electric restructuring has led to a boom in nonutility power generation.  The 
EIA report found that total nonutility generation in 1999 reached 167,357 MW, 
which was a 71% increase from the previous year.  However, only 21% of the 
total represented new plants.  In 1999, about 50,000 MW of electric utility 
generation assets were purchased by nonutility generation companies.  At the 
end of 1999, nonutility generation accounted for 19.8% of total electric 
generation in the country.  The totals reported by EIA include all operable 
units, even those that did not run at all in 1999 but are expected to return 
to service. 

Gas-fired power accounted for the largest share of nonutility generation last 
year, and the Pacific Census Division accounted for 31.4% of that gas-fired 
capacity. The Pacific Census Division also accounted for the greatest number 
(1,167) of total nonutility generation and the most nonutility capacity 
(33,254 MW). California was the dominant state in the division with 30,189 
MW. 

Gas-fired (only) generation represented 29.4% (49,353 MW) of total nonutility 
capacity in 1999, and petroleum/natural gas (fuel switchable/combined) 
generation accounted for 24.2% (40,508 MW) of the total. Coal represented 
28.9% (48,501 MW).  Hydroelectric power accounted for 3.6%. Petroleum (only) 
totaled 2.2% and all other sources amounted to 11.5% of total nonutility 
generation. 

The top five states based on existing nameplate capacity are California 
(30,189 MW), Illinois (24,013 MW), New York (17,256 MW), Pennsylvania (12,483 
MW) and Texas (12,376 MW).

I spoke with Richard and we will have to renew.  He is currently trying to 
get the PX bankruptcy court to allow us  to take back our security in light 
of the FERC ruling re chargebacks, but due to uncertainty of the FERC ruling, 
court has not been willing to allow us to remove. Richard continues on the 
case.  In the meanwhile, the PX/bankruptcy court will not allow the LC's to 
expire without drawing down.  So we should go ahead and renew.

pleasant.  I think it is hightly unlikely that Larry will be coming up with 
an additional 7FA turbine - but you can call him.  I'm also starting to think 
as the LM position starts to get better managed that maybe you and Chris 
should take the D5's and 7EA's onto your book.  Something to think about, I 
am just concerned about your ability to manage more complex deals without 
some resource availability.  I think you have to feel pretty good about the 
LM position first.  Something to think about?

Hey Dave, what's the real deal on the 7FA ""swap"" with Larry Izzo? Do they 
have the capability to give us another 7FA in 2001-2002? I listened to two 
voicemails from Cogentrix this am and they do seem to be serious about 
purchasing an incremental 1-2 7FA's if they can be delivered by winter 2002. 
I think their preference is to buy the turbine from us on the front end with 
no partnering in the project. There has been no serious negotiation on this 
to date and I don't want Scott to waste his time if we really don't have the 
turbine from EE&CC. Please advise. Thanks.

Per our telephone conversation today, I have been asked by two Cogentrix 
executives if we have any General Electric 7FA turbines (for delivery in 
2002) available for sale. I believe that Cogentrix needs the turbine for one 
of the combined cycle projects it has been permitting in Entergy or TVA. They 
seen somewhat anxious.

As we discussed, I will let Cogentrix know about the availability of the two 
General Electric 7EA's and the two Westinghouse 501-D's. What about the 7FA 
that Dave Delainey loaned to EE&CC, could this turbine be available for sale 
to Cogentrix?

I don't see a problem with this since the language is standard in most of our

Station language get finalized? I was working with Dave Kistler on this and 
have not heard anything from him on this in over a month. You might check w/ 
him or Mark Tawney to make sure that we include the most recent wording. 

One last query - how is the Confirm Desk going to know whether we have 
included the language as part of the ISDA Master?  They also need to keep in 
mind that with some CP's, such as American Re - we have agreed special 
wording with them and so will have to continue using the longer version of 
confirmation.

The confirms desk has asked us to think about a way that we could shorten the 
confirms that are sent out under Master Agreements by amending each Master to 
include definitions/provisions that are common to all confirms.  Below is 
what I have come up with.  Do you see any problems with this?

Here are my initial thoughts on how we can possibly shorten the weather 
confirms that are done under a Master Agreement.  It seems like we could 
amend the Masters to include the following definitions which seem to be used 
in each conform:

Payment Date
NCDC
NWS
HDD
CDD
The Fallback Reference Weather Station procedures - the confirm would 
identify just the Fallback Reference Weather Station
Data Sources

Let me know what you think.

Alos, is it necessary to specify bank account information if that is already 
set forth in the Master?

		 Subject: Re: Hedge Fund and CTA list

Bob:

Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue is 
that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus 
will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents 
before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic 
corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent 
elsewhere.

The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates 
to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term 
Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, 
orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of 
teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of 
messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge 
funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying 
much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past 
and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested: 
notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federal 
regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to 
speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a 
large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the 
financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.]

For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the 
internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or 
individuals - for similar reasons).  

Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their 
customers just as Brokers cannot.

Harry,

Further to our conversation last week, I have listed below, in two segments, 
the top CTAs who presently manage more than $100mill each, and the top Hedge 
Funds, based upon their likelihood to manage assets in diversified markets, 
that may include tangible commodities. My understanding of EOL is that it 
presently caters primarily to this latter group and offers only tangible 
commodity trading instruments.

As I explained, the principle difference between a Hedge Fund and a CTA 
(Commodity Trading Advisor), is the manner in which they control the assets 
that they are contracted to manage. In the case of a CTA, the money can not 
be held by the CTA itself. The underlying investor will open a clearing 
account with a respective Clearing House, the assets will remain in this 
account and the CTA will trade based on the full monetary value of that 
account - in many cases an investor may well fund this account with Notional 
Funding. NF are 'abstract funds' not actually deposited at the Clearing 
House, but acknowledged as being available should variation or original 
margin be required. The CTA has no control over these funds. All monetary 
transactions must be executed by the Clearing House, and must be authorized 
by the investor. The CTA does have the ability to execute trades at an other 
trading house - such as Enron, through a contractual document called an 
International Uniform Give-Up Agreement. We have quite a few hundred of these 
agreements in NY. Essentially, all parties involved in the execution of a 
trade - the CTA, the Investor, the Executing Broker and the Clearing House, 
agree to allow the CTA to trade wherever he/she wishes and Give-Up that trade 
to the Investor's Clearing House. Since every regulated trade must ultimately 
clear the respective exchange, for a CTA to trade OTC and Swap agreements, 
would require prior notification to an investor that his/her money may be 
required as collateral against such a trade, and would be required to be 
deposited at Enron. A Hedge Fund has greater flexibility to trade such 
instruments since in the majority of instances a Hedge Fund does exert 
control over the funds it manages. A Hedge Fund typically structures its 
investment vehicles as Off-Shore limited partnership funds. As such the Hedge 
fund has direct control over the underlying assets and can move those assets 
to wherever they may be required - if investing via Enron On-Line, it would 
move the assets to Enron, for example.

This first list, below, is comprised of the top flight CTAs :



The following list is of Hedge Funds that I believe are trading Commodities 
and other non-security investments. It is by no means complete ! :



I would be happy to make any introductions that I can to any of the above 
names. Some we know well, others we may have to network ourselves into. 
Caroline and I met a few weeks ago and I passed some names on to her - I am 
not sure where that has got to yet, but if you need any further information 
please call me.

something I hadn't noticed before. In EnPower, we have several choices for 
the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia index, but none called specifically ""Mid-C Firm 
Peak."" We have non-firm peak, and something called ""Mid-Columbia Index."" 

I'm just wondering how to specify that I want the deal to settle against the 
Dow Jones Mid-C PEAK index. In this case, because I was entering a 
round-the-clock (all hours, all days) deal, I had to enter three different 
deals to specify the three different indices - Mid-C Peak, Mid-C Off Peak, 
and Mid-C Sundays and Holidays. But I don't see a Mid-C Peak choice, so I 
entered the first as Mid-C Index.

Deal numbers are:
597244 - Peak
597245 - Off Peak
597246 - Sundays/Holidays

I just wanted to ask because when you guys plug the index prices in here I 
want to make sure that ""Mid-C Index"" gets the peak price. Could you let me 
know if it doesn't? And if that's the case, then I'll need to have another 
pub code set up for peak price.

Thanks for your help on this. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Subject: FAQ's regarding Agency.

Mark,

I would appreciate your comments on the following FAQ's, intended to be a 
guide for Louise/myself/PR in the event we take a media call regarding the 
injunction/lawsuit. Also, if you have any ideas to expand the list, please 
let me know.


Any calls received from the media will be answered by Louise, or in Louise' 
absence, by myself, with PR in the room (Louise will be back in the office on 
Monday and I suspect it is very unlikely that we would receive any calls 
before then).

Q1 Did Agency.com develop EnronOnline?
A Agency.com was hired to provide development support for some elements of 
EnronOnline. Other elements were designed and built by Enron staff.

Q2 Which elements did Agency.com develop?
A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements 
which Agency was involved in developing.

Q3 What parts of the system did Enron develop?
A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements 
which Enron developed.

Q4 Why have you filed an injunction against Agency?
A We believe that Agency has been releasing confidential information without 
authorisation from Enron.

Q5 What is the amount of your lawsuit?
A We are not releasing that information at this time.

Q6 Do you believe that the release of this information by Agency has damaged 
the competitive lead of EnronOnline?
A We believe that Agency has released information in contravention of the 
terms of their contract with us. Whether or not this release of information 
is damaging to EnronOnline is a matter which has yet to be determined.

Q7 Does this experience make you want to avoid working with outside agencies?
A We believe that outside agencies are a valuable source of expertise which 
can complement the Enron's strong IT skillset. We don't believe that the 
actions of one company in any way tarnishes the ability of other, very 
capable IT consultancy companies.

Q8 Are you happy with the product which Agency.com provided?
A We are very pleased with the final product represented by EnronOnline, but 
are not in a position to comment on the strength of any of the individual 
contributors.

Q9 Prior to this lawsuit, would you have recommended Agency.com to other 
companies looking to build something like EnronOnline?
A No. We would not have recommended for or against the use of Agency.com.

Q10 You must be quite angry that a consultant has splashed your information 
into a public forum.
A We are disappointed that the confidentiality between ourselves and our 
contractor does not seem to have been upheld.

Q11 What do you hope to gain from this lawsuit/injunction?
A We hope to prevent the further release of confidential information.

Q12  If all you want to do is prevent the release of information, why are you 
also filing a lawsuit?
A The lawsuit is required at this time to enable the injunction. If it is 
found that damages have been caused as a result of the information which has 
already been released, then compensation may also be appropriate.

Subject: Policy draft for confirmations

Mark, 

Below please find my policy draft for confirm generation guidelines.  As I 
would ultimately like for someone from legal to officially sign off on 
something like this, please review with that in mind.  Thanks very much.  
Please call  me if you have questions or comments.  

""All FX deals are to be verbally confirmed as soon as possible after the 
trade is executed.   A comment should be written on the deal ticket noting 
who the deal was confirmed with and the date and time.  Once a deal has been 
verbally confirmed, and entered into TAGG, deals with an expiration within 
one week of the trade date should be sent to the file room.  If the deal has 
settlements beyond one week from  the trade date, a confirmation should be 
generated based on the template for that particular counterparty.  All 
intercompany deals should be paper confirmed.  

In the event that we are unable to verbally confirm a transaction by the end 
of trade date + one, a written confirmation should be generated and sent to 
the counterparty.    

Any discrepancies noted when verbally confirming should be brought to the 
traders attention.""

Thanks.  LEt me know what you think.

talking average monthly volumes of 7,300-7,500 MMBTU for approximately 6-8 
months at a price around $10/MMBTU.  I'm sending you this as a ""reminder"", as

Jeff,

We've obtained a tariff filing that Sempra made with the CRE in Mexico to 
determine the transportation rates charged by Sempra International to 
transport gas in Mexico.  Can you help us determine the transport rate 
charged to move gas from the California border to the Mexican border through 
Socal and SDG&E?  I understand that SDG&E may be able to negotiate a rate 
that includes the fee paid to Socal?  Is that correct?

What I'm trying to determine is what will be the rate for us to obtain a 
backhaul from a new LNG regas terminal in Mexico, through the Sempra 
International pipeline in Mexico and through SDG&E, to an end user behind 
Socal?  Do you know how this works or do you have a suggestion on how we can 
determine the max rates, plus determine what ""actual"" rates have been 
negotiated?  We have discussions with Sempra this friday and want to table 
the issue of firm backhauls.

Thanks

Jeff Hodge asked that I respond to your e-mail.  

ENA does use the GISB contract to conduct its ""spot"" business.  By ""spot"", I 
mean interruptible gas deals of any length and firm deals one month or less 
in duration.  Enron also has its own form of spot agreement that we use.  I 
have attached a copy of that agreement.

We do try to negotiate some special provisions into each GISB.  Our current 
version of the special provisions is included in the GISB agreement that is 
attached.  I do not know of any company that uses the GISB as-is.

We do not use the GISB for firm deals that are greater than one month in 
duration.  For those deals, we use our Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement that I have attached.

If you need copies of actual confirmations, Bob Bowen or Ellen Wallumrod 
would be able to give you examples.  Form confirmations are at the back of 
each of the agreements attached.

If you need additional information, please let me know.

Mary,
Based upon our recent discussions with you regarding the set up of a Global 
Custody account, you may want to have the same discussions with Enron Credit 
who are pursuing a Global Custody Account with BONY.  Richard Sage is the 
Contoller for the Business unit and Anna is the Settlements person who is 
working to get the account established.

Richard and Anna,
Sara, Laurel and I have been having discussions regarding our requested 
Global Custody account with Mary.  Mary has some specific concerns which she 
may want to make sure are addressed with your set up of the account as well.

Thanks. Sheila

The missing Richter trades are all EES sleeves that he neglected to enter

Chris Mallory said he's enter the deals first thing in the morning. 

The Fischer deals - 563728 and 563729 - have been changed to Constellation, 
per Matt Motley who did the trades.

And the other two deals where the brokers have been changed look fine. Would 
you let me know beforehand next time, just in the offhand chance that the 
trader entered other things in the deal incorrectly? Thanks for your help.

I didn't get back to you earlier about Suzanne, but yes, I am interested in 
chipping in on that.  It's a great idea, and Suzanne should love it!  Let me

whether her sister used an agency?  They are much more recently in the market

if I recall correctly (and I always do) someone once said they had a little 
bit of a ""problem"" gambling and I could not in good conscious have acted as 
an enabler.  And, a true fan (longhorn or not) is there through the good 
times and the bad and believe me I been there through it all (a degrading 
loss to your alma mater, as well as an unbelievably beautiful victory over 
Nebraska) always managing to stick it out no matter how bleak things got.  
Speaking of which it must sting being beat by the last place team in your 
conference...but I'm sure the Pac-10's record against non-conference 
opponents is really helping to ease that blow.  Speaking of feather's in the 
conference cap, looks like our next national champion is going to be from the 
Big 12 - will wonders never cease.

My Monday is going great, thank you very much and I will show extreme 
restraint and refrain from any Chips comments ( Besides, I don't have time to

Well, given the impressive results of Friday's game, I suppose I should've 
taken the bet...I mean I knew we were good, but I didn't realize we were THAT 
good.  Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not 
too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a 
force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm 
right.  With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the 
charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager 
to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance 
Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.  My 
condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .

Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your Aggie 
co-workers through this trying time.

Subject:  Letter agreement

Gentlemen,

I've revised paragraph 5 to reflect our discussion.  Also, I made a change
to paragraph 7 to include technical bulletins per Mitch's request which we
did not discuss on our call.

(See attached file: WestinghouseProposal to Resolve Issues on Enron - Dec10

discussed the counterparty name ""Minerals Management Service"" with my boss, 
Mark Taylor, General Counsel of ENA, and he agreed that agencies and 
departments of the US government should have the correct governmental 
agency/department as part of the counterparty name.  You could say ""Minerals 
Management Service"" is a dba for the US Department of the Interior.  We 
generally do not like to contract with dbas, we want the legal entity as part 
of the name.  A more appropriate name for this counterparty is ""US Department 
of the Interior Minerals Management Service"".  The way the exposure rolls up 
under the GCP System is an exposure issue, not a contract issue.  If you 
disagree with this assessment, please call Mark Taylor at x37459.

Hi Tana,

I tend to agree with you, however, that's the verified name in the GCP 
System. Exposure roll-up should be fine, being that it's Ultimate Parent is 
the Government of the United States. If you have proof of a CP Name 
discrepancy, it should be directed to Global SAP (Cheryl Johnson, x3-3101).

Have a Great Day Tana !!

I'm not so sure I agree with your name change for US Department of the 
Interior.  I think as part of the name we've got to have that it's a govt 
agency.  Anything else would be misleading to what it actually is.  I think 
more appropriate would be United States Department of the Interior, Minerals 
Management Service.

Hi, I was wondering if it would too time consuming for you to add a note in 
the comments box inside deal entry when you change a deal.  We always try to 
put a note in the comments box so it is easier to research what has changed 
on a trade in the future.  If you could add notes it would help us out when 
we are researching past deals.  Let me know what you think.

In order to track the proliferation of electronic trading agreements, 
licensing/software agreements and electronic platforms, we (Sam, Stephanie 
and me) have established a ""process"" which includes the following:

1.  sending immediate email to Ted Murphy, legal and credit (Bradford) from 
the commercial group identifying the Enron party needing the agreement, and 
necessity for agreement

2.  depending on the type of agreement, credit may or may not need to get 
involved.

3.  the paralegals enter the agreement onto Lotus Notes so that we can track 
the process.

4.  upon execution, a copy of the agreement is kept in a red file (near Sam's 
desk), a copy is sent to Ted Murphy, and the original is sent to global 
contracts.

To my knowledge, we have not established a procedure for tracking passwords 
(to the extent required/changed).

will be getting more info on why the other 8 were not well received.  If 
anyone thinks a manifest injustice or mistake has occurred let me know.  
Ditto if you think anyone's prior background makes them a candidate for a

     On the ""yeses"", please let me know who you would like to follow up on

wants to call any of the ""no's"", to commisserate, that's OK too. - - -DLH

How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to 
the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost 
of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two 
bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy 
and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

PennFuture's E-cubed is a commentary biweekly email publication  concerning 
the
current themes and trends in the energy market.


February 5, 2001
Vol. 3, No. 3

Breaking Out of the  Box

Two weeks after his inauguration, President Bush's  electricity policy is 
already
emerging from the crucible of California and is  characterized by obedience to
free market ideology and a federalism that  confines the federal government 
to a
limited, backseat role.

We are  told that California's crisis is an isolated event, the result  of
California's unique mistakes. In this view, the federal government  neither
contributed to the crisis nor has a major role to play in solving it.  
Wholesale
market caps at any level are declared to be an inappropriate  intrusion into 
free
markets that can only make things worse. Moreover, the  appointment of Curt
Hebert as the new Chairman of the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC)
signals that FERC will not assert itself to  ensure that wholesale electricity
markets are genuinely competitive and that  the principles of open access and
comparability are more than legal fictions.  Finally, environmental 
regulation is
fingered as a primary obstacle to  adequate supplies and reasonable prices.

This emerging policy begins with  a misdiagnosis. In fact, the mess in 
California
and the West has roots in  huge policy mistakes made by both the state and
federal governments. One such  federal mistake was a 1995 FERC decision that
blocked a competitive  solicitation for 1400 megawatts of new generation in
California. Skyrocketing  retail electric prices in more and more states due 
to
wholesale market  failure will soon make clear to all that the nation's 
electricity
problems  start in Washington DC with failed wholesale market policies. The 
hot
seat  will then shift from Governor Gray Davis to federal officials and it 
will  become
apparent that strict obedience to free market ideology or a limited  role for
federal authority will not?cure?past mistakes in electric  policy.

President Bush inherits an America where wholesale electricity  markets are
isolated and dysfunctional - ticking time bombs planted beneath  his 
Presidency.
The fuses on these bombs were lit with the passage of the  Energy Policy Act
(EPACT) in 1992, which deregulated the price of generation  in the wholesale
electric market but left FERC with the job of creating a  genuinely 
competitive
wholesale market which would restrain prices through  competitive pressures.

But neither FERC nor Congress has ensured the free  movement of electricity in
interstate commerce or workably competitive  markets since the passage of 
EPACT.
Market power abuses are rife, and most  parts of the country don't even have 
the
benefit of an independent system  operator to ensure nondiscrimination and 
open
access to the transmission  grids. Even so, FERC will not compel formation of 
or
utility membership in  independent system operators.

Worse yet, in the face of opposition from  states and several powerful 
utilities,
Congress has fiddled its thumbs on  national restructuring legislation for 
five
years and has not required a  transition to retail competition in every 
state. By
failing to open retail  markets, Congress has ensured that wholesale 
electricity
markets cannot be  effectively disciplined by demand changes or long-term 
retail
contracts.  Meanwhile, states behave as if they are electric islands immune 
from
the  results of failed federal stewardship of wholesale markets. Foolishly,  
they
have become a principal stumbling block to optimally sized regional  power
markets and encourage FERC timidity by banging the drums of states'  rights on
Capitol Hill.

To this day, with 58,000 megawatts under its  control, PJM is the largest
wholesale market or free-trade zone for  electricity in the country and it
amounts to no more than 6 percent of the  nation's electric industry. The
remaining 94 percent of the industry are  divided into hundreds of wholesale
markets with unique rules for pricing and  operation.

So nine years after EPACT, the bombs have begun to go off,  first in 
California,
where disastrous state policies mixed with federal  mistakes have created a
spectacular explosion, then in Washington and Idaho,  two states that have not
passed retail restructuring laws, where retail rates  are going up as much as 
84
percent and 29 percent respectively. And it's only  a matter of time before 
these
electricity time bombs explode in other  states.

The reality is that both the federal government's actions and  inaction have 
made
problems worse in California and elsewhere. Denying that  fact thwarts any
efforts to fix the problem, as does attacking environmental  protection or
endlessly repeating free market and states' rights  ideology.

Hopefully it's not heresy but it must be said:  Strong federal action and wise
intervention are required if  wholesale markets are to be stabilized and  made
competitive.

First, the federal government must  organize the country into 10 or 12 
regional
wholesale electric markets, each  administered by an Independent System 
Operator
that has the legal duty and  necessary authority to ensure that each market is
reliable and genuinely  competitive. Each ISO must have clear responsibility 
to
identify and prevent  market power abuses in order to protect public 
confidence
in electricity  markets and prevent more autopsies like that now being done on
California's  effort to deregulate.

Second, and absolutely crucial for the formation of  competitive electricity
markets, the federal government should require that  every state equip its 
retail
customers with time-of-use metering and  appliance control devices (thermostat
resetting and others) which increase  the price elasticity of demand.

Third, electric markets cannot be  competitive if either the wholesale or 
retail
market remain closed. All  customers should be allowed to choose electricity
suppliers by a certain,  specific date.

Fourth, fuel diversity and clean energy have a clear value  in these markets -
federal restructuring legislation should promote fuel  diversity as well as
address a host of major environmental problems by  establishing reasonable
renewable energy requirements.

Fifth, the  federal government must face up to the fact that in periods of 
peak
demand or  system emergency conditions, suppliers currently have almost total
pricing  power and that high wholesale price caps are an immediate necessity. 
At
such  times, the price curve looks like a ""J,"" with prices unlimited by  
demand
changes climbing straight up. The three wholesale markets that are  
administered
by viable independent system operators - PJM, New York, and New  England - all
operate with a $1,000 per megawatt-hour price cap. They use  caps not because
they aren't committed to making competition work, but  because demand is not
currently responsive to price and because these  emerging markets are 
vulnerable
to strategic bidding that could destroy  public support for more competition.

The sternest test of leadership for  a modern politician is to face down his
friends and the greatest act of  friendship is to save a friend from himself. 
The
President could lessen the  need for caps by telling some of his friends in 
the
energy industry that they  are behaving like a Marxist caricature of 
businessmen
who only need to be  given enough rope in order to hang themselves. Some
wholesale energy  suppliers - by persisting in wholesale markets that cannot
limit prices by  competition or demand response to charge $1,000, $2,000, 
$3,000
or more per  megawatt-hour, prices that greatly exceed any cost or profit
requirement -  have triggered a public reaction that could eventually crush 
them.
For  example, in California, the recently passed emergency state  statute
""suspends"" retail direct access and many communities are  understandably
beginning the process of forming municipal  utilities.

The President must remind wholesale energy suppliers of the  need for 
restraint
while America's dysfunctional wholesale electricity  markets are repaired.

Americans deserve true, functional, clean and  affordable competitive electric
markets. Because energy bills often consume  at least 10 percent of an average
family's income, and up to 50 percent of a  poor household's take-home pay, 
most
Americans have little tolerance for high  energy costs. And, as Jimmy Carter
discovered, the families that carry lunch  buckets hold the people in 
government
responsible for energy shortages and  price spikes.

President Bush himself seems to sense that energy threatens  his Presidency -
electricity alone could be its downfall. Perhaps his talent  for political
survival will yet cause the President to change course on  electric policy and
break out of the confined ideological box which he  appears on the verge of
entering.

The fate of his presidency, and our  energy future, may hang in the balance.

Hi Sara,
Thanks for the update.  With respect to First Union Corp., the holding
company of First Union National Bank (""FUNB"")  providing a guaranty, I don't
believe that's an option. FUNB is a rated entity and as mentioned in my Jan.
23rd email, we can provide quarterly call reports (with year-to-date
information), which is also available on the FDIC page (www.fdic.gov). First
Union Corporation's consolidated annual financial statements are available
on EDGAR as well as First Union's home page (www.firstunion.com).  I look
forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.  It seems that our
marketers are asking for credit approval to enter into the Shenandoah trade
today without the Master in place. If approval is given, we will need mutual
downgrade provisions in our confirm.  I think all other pending trades are
on hold until we can get our docs wrapped up.

Where does EPMI fit in if we are doing a financial power swap?  Who are the 
Enron entities that are involved and what contracts are currently in place 
with the Kaiser entities?  Are we netting overall exposures and using one 
collateral threshold?  Are we cross defaulting all of the contracts?  What 
exactly do you want to accomplish with the netting agreement?

		 Subject: Kaiser US/UK Setoff w/MG and ENA

Carol,

West power is looking to do a financial swap with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical 
Corporation (""Kaiser Aluminum"") whereby Kaiser Aluminium would buy the swap 
and pay ENA float.  Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. (""Kaiser 
International"") has a big market presence in the UK and MG has significant 
forward financial and physical metals positions with Kaiser International 
which I believe are quite out-of-the-money.

Can we find out whether or not we can perform a bilateral, affiliate NETTING 
AGREEMENT between Kaiser International and Kaiser Aluminum with MG and EPMI?  
If the UK is going to continue to do short-term new metals business with 
Kaiser International and if we can get comfortable with metals forward 
positions that are OTM, we would like to use this position and leverage off 
of it for trading liquidity in the states.  Secondly, does the netting need 
to just pertain to global financial business or can it include physical as 
well?

If possible, I'd like to see if you and a UK trading attorney can speak about 
the overall concept and briefly address any UK and domestic law conflicts.  
Please call when you have a opportunity to discuss.  ENA is looking to enter 
into a power swap for June '01.  I'm not sure if this concept is achievable, 
and if it is, in the time frame we're facing.  However, if we can't do a June 
swap, then we'll try for a July swap.

Regards,
Tracy

European Gas CERA Alert: Signposts to a High Demand Path for Natural Gas: The 
Large Combustion Plant Directive and German Nuclear Phaseout

Abstract 
Two unrelated developments at the end of June both point in the direction of 
a long-term high demand growth path for natural gas in Europe, consistent 
with CERA's Blue Gold scenario. Both the approval of the Large Combustion 
Plant Directive by EU environment ministers and the agreement on German 
nuclear phaseout between the German government and industry could involve the 
early removal of existing, low-cost generating plants from the European power 
capital stock in the 2010-15 time period and their subsequent replacement by 
natural gas-fired turbines.

Subject: Power Decree 804 and Resolution 135


This is to inform you the recent approval of the below commented rules in 
Argentina. If the economic and political environment gets calmer, these rules 
will be an important step in the power deregulation process an will allow us 
to reach some of the goals set for the regulatory group for this year.

Goal 1- Eliminate or Increase fuel declaration caps: there will not be more 
fuel declarations but price declarations (Section 1, Resolution 135). The 
rules do not mention any cap for price declarations.

Goal 2 - Daily fuel declaration: The 6 month fuel declaration was replaced by 
a daily price declaration (Section 1, Resolution 135).

Goal 3 - Reduce or eliminate the obligation to physically back up agreements 
with end users or LDCs: According to the interpretation of AGEERA (Gencos 
Association) we would have been gotten also this objective and marketers may 
already buy or sell spot as long as the contract with the customer does not 
have supply guarantee (Section 5, Resolution 135). It is not clear in the 
rule wich is the condition for marketers to buy or sell spot.

Now the Secretariat of Energy must issue its own Resolution to amend the 
technical Procedures in line with these rules. From the text of Resolution 
135 (sections 3 c, 5 and considerations) there would be a good probability to 
reach other two goals through the Secretariat of Energy rule:
Reduce minimum term for Output & Demand Marketing Agreements to one month
Eliminate or reduce to 1 MW the threshold for Output Marketing Agreements

Amr and I are asisting Buenos Aires Ofice to analize the new rules to 
eventually submit comments to the Secretariat of Energy.
Attached is the document with the regulatory goals.

Subject: Power Decree 804 and Resolution 135

In an attempt to further reduce State intervention in the power market, on 
June 19, the Executive Branch issued Decree 804/01 which completes the 
deregulation process of the power industry initiated in 1992, and amends 
Electricity Law 24.065.  On June 26 the Minister of Infrastructure issued 
Resolution 135/01 setting forth  the guidelines for the future regulation of 
the Decree. 

The Secretariat of Energy's resolution that will regulate the Decree will be 
effective as from September 1, 2001. All agents of the electric sector will 
be invited to comment the terms of regulatory decree, although such comments 
will be used for informational purposes and will not bind the Secretariat of 
Energy to make any changes whatsoever to its original document.  

Although Decree No 804/01 is effective as from today, there are doubts in the 
industry as to whether it will be abolished in the future by Congress.  The 
reason for this uncertainty is that such Decree was issued within the 
framework of the Competitivity Law, by which Congress delegated to the 
Executive Branch its  powers to legislate  specifically on changes required 
to transform the economy.  Although this Decree and the changes it fosters 
indirectly affect the economy, since the law it amends is not purely 
""economical"", it may be questioned.  There is no term within which Congress 
may exercise this right. 

Please find a summary of the relevant changes below.

Generators Remuneration:
Forward Market: freely negotiated
Spot Market:  only payment of ""hourly spot price"" at each node.
Hourly Spot Price: determined by price offers based on demand and 
transportation constraints


Daily Declarations
The day before the daily dispatch, each Generator shall: 
declare its price offers for each  peak, shoulder and valley hour at its 
node; 
declare its maximum operating limits and minimum available capacity;  
offer all of its available capacity.

Calculation of Hourly Spot Price ""HSP""
HSP shall be calculated by the OED according to procedure to be determined by 
the Secretariat of Energy, not based on marginal costs as it is today.
Prices shall be calculated at each node before the initiation of each day.
At the end of each day prices shall be recalculated based off real operations 
on the system.

Spot Market
Generators and Marketers shall be paid on an hourly basis according to the 
volume of energy delivered at the node, which shall be valued at the HSP.
If distributors, large users and/or marketers enter into supply contracts 
then to clear transactions on the spot market , the OED shall consider that 
the sellers (Marketers/Generators) assume their clients payment obligations 
before the market.
On spot market transactions, Generators shall not receive payments for any 
other concept.

Forward Market
Generators and Marketers may enter into contracts with distributors, 
marketers and large users at freely negotiated prices and terms.

Marketers
Are now considered agents of the electric sector.
May enter into forward contracts and/or carry our purchase and sale 
transactions on the spot market at the node HSP.
Must declare their offer and demand at each node of the system.
Their obligations shall be similar to those of Generators and Distributors 
when they transact at the MEM.

Congestion Rights  
Right to receive profits resulting from the difference in energy prices 
between two nodes related to the link and the capacity charge of the relevant 
transmission system.
In the case of: 
Existing transportation lines under concession, these rights belong to the 
State, which will sell them under a public offering called by the  
Secretariat of Energy.
Existing transportation lines carried out by an independent transporter shall 
belong to such transporter.
New transportation lines, shall belong to the owner of the same.

Expansions
Sole Risk Investment Expansions: Open to anyone who is interested; will 
require technical and environmental certification of the ENRE and license 
from the                 Secretariat of  Energy.

System Reliability Expansions:  Shall be built by awardee of public tender.

Distributors
Have to satisfy all demand of users within their area that have the choice of 
independently contracting their supply in the  MEM; Distributors may offer 
contracting options with or without supply guaranty; these contracts shall be 
considered special contracts
When they contract their demand with Generators and/or Marketers, the general 
terms of the contracts as well as the procedure for selecting suppliers will 
be subject to guidelines established by the Secretariat of Energy;
In order for the price under these contracts to be passed through to their 
end users tariffs, the relation between the term of the contracts and the 
volume purchased must comply with a chart that basically states that the 
greater the term of the contract, the lesser the percentage of contracted 
energy.
In any case, the total amount of energy contracted can not be in excess of 
the total demand of users that can't transact on the MEM.

Forced Dispatch
Distributors may request forced dispatch of certain units;
The Distributor that requests forced dispatch is responsible for payment of 
the same, Secretariat of Energy to control if forced dispatch costs are 
reasonable.
Such price shall not be transferred to end users and shall not be taken into 
account to calculate the HSP.

Kishkill/SA/Enron@Enron 

Subject: Cuiaba Issues - July 6 situation-

Topic I -- Amendment 4

We spent the morning perfecting Aditivo 4 with Furnas, to cover the situation 
where the commissioning plan did not go as scheduled. It was signed early 
afternoon and sent to Eletrobras.

The Eletrobras Diretoria had not followed this issue closely and need legal 
clearance. Furnas and the Ministry (Perazzo) called to give it priority. Late 
at night we received word that the ""parecer"" (opinion) was ready and that it 
the Anex would  signed by Eletrobras next Monday and entered into their Board 
meeting next Tuesday.

Petrobras sent us the letter we asked but took out of their version a key 
word ""only"". ""Only"" refers that they will not go after us for non-payment if 
Furnas does not pay. In the letter they also stated that they will commence 
the loading operation -- at their own risk - Saturday. This was requested by 
Perazzo to save logistical time because it takes three days to get to Cuiaba 
from the refinery. 

[Advised Laine of the situation to check Monday how many trucks were loaded 
and  in transit]

We contacted Perazzo through Sergio Assad to get his word that there would 
not be a last minute hitch; otherwise, we may have to refuse to take the 
diesel and would create a BIG PR problem for all.

Topic III - Consent Package (Opinions, Aditivo, Consent)
Furnas came in with the list of issues they wanted to discuss. I instead 
insisted that we treat this meeting as a continuation of the MME meeting and 
follow the Agenda  by looking at the Consent document package -- actually go 
over the text -  that they find objectionable, and,  if it the text had a 
direct link with any of their issues, we would discuss and examine the 
relative positions. 

What they told me is what they have told me before, that some of the issues 
have nothing to do with the Consent but they want it as a condition to agree 
to the package. Which is fine to me, because it will make it clear to the 
government what we have been saying --- they want to change the deal. In 
Furnas' defense, I need to add that they feel they have been handed a bad 
contract  and they want regulatory relief, which it has been granted, on a 
case-by-case basis, in other deals. So part of their strategy is to force 
MME, or Aneel to provide some tariff relief.

I asked them to list out  the key issues with the Consent-  Old-- a) the 90 
days additional time (Furnas), b) The guarantee substitution at the time of 
privatization, c) the lenders involvement on contract changes ""we do not want 
to go to Washington to negotiate"" - Newer - d) giving up their right to ask 
Aneel to ""homologar"", ratify; rather than ""registrar"" contract changes [big 
risk for us] . I believe the have more direct issues. 

We go back to Rio Monday (another holiday down the drain) ..and Tuesday to 
complete the list -- Topic II -- Regulatory conflicts

Hi Vince,

 regarding David Port's response to Kevin Kindall's email, I feel that I 
should respond, at least to make our position clear.  Please indicate if the 
following response is appropriate -------

""Hi David,

  I understand that you were slightly upset over a comment Kevin Kindall made 
in one of his weekly reports.  The intention was never to disparage anybody.  
It is just that since Research gets data from a large number of sources, we 
feel obligated to the data donor to ask any requester for clarification of 
need.  I completely understand that RAC typically has access to much 
sensitive information and they have a right to know much information.  We 
just want to make sure there is open flow of information (it is in 
everybody's best interests and the company's best interests) and that 
everybody is aware of how data is flowing.  

Best wishes,

Subject: RE: Weekly report

Kevin - thanks for the update.

On the Stock option Plans, if your angle is what I suspect, I suggest you get 
with Rudi Zipter, who has done a great deal of work on this exposure, 
including characterising and actually booking the short option positions in 
Enron's equity system. We are already working with Ben Glisan's team firming 
up a hedging program. We are well advanced in this effort so if you get with 
my people it could save you a great deal of time.

Secondly, I am afraid I do take some exception to your references to Naveen's 
team in your last point. Generally in RAC I don't believe we are obliged to 
explain why we need information, except as a courtesy - otherwise that would 
compromise our role somewhat. Specifically, I am aware of the sensitivity of 
Raptor, just as I am of the sensitivity of all the information my group is 
privvy to on a daily basis. Again, we have done a good deal of work on these 
structures too (I see a position report daily). As I have discussed with 
Vince, Naveen's request would have been derived from a discussion we all had 
with Rick, concerning ""meltdown"" scenarios and their effect on, amongst other 
things, funding vehicles. 

But I would rather have had a conversation about this than see slightly 
disparaging remarks about my people in email traffic.

I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
Enron Analyst/Associate program.

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
invited.

Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research in
particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).

My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this

talking points for your use.

Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.

In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new 
capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by 
proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak 
demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, 
has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not 
deregulation.

When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, 
Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego 
customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current 
summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of 
Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded 
where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers 
because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside 
of the PX (i.e. the spot market).

In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional 
generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.  
Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time 
for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market 
responds.

The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition 
not reregulation.  Policy makers should:

Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it 
is needed.

Expedite interconnection of new generation.

Expedite siting of new facilities.

Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side 
solutions.

Dasovich of our San Francisco office.

PA

They wish to amend the PA such that:

Enron warrants that their use of the passwords and the Website does not cause 
them to breach any third party rights 
they only notify us of unauthorised disclosure or use of passwords upon their 
learning of the same.
they can withdraw or amend information provided to Enron from time to time

ETA

They do not want to be bound by future terms and conditions imposed by Enron 
(see 1(iii))
They wish to restrict our use of information to Enron Group companies (see 
last sentence of 2(b))
They feel unable to make the statement in the first sentence of 2(d), since 
they trade through various group company agents on behalf of a BV principal
To establish a tangible audit trail and for verification, they wish to be 
able to verify our paper confirms (see 3(e))
They wish to restructure the indemnity entirely (see 4), such that each party 
is liable for losses suffered by the other due to its own wilful 
default/negligence/omission.
They wish to have the right to terminate the ETA (see 6(a)), and wish that 
electronic notices be deemed sent when the sender receives notice from the 
system of delivery or failed delivery (see 6(e)).

Some of these are more important than others, but there are some key points.  
Please let me know what you think - thanks

Jim, we are pleased to advise that AEGIS is putting the final touches on the
wording and we hope to have it to you shortly.  In working with them, we
made note of the obligations of both Enron and AEGIS as respects
documentation to support the contract.  In particular, AEGIS is obligated
pursuant to VIII. (c) to provide an accounting of the EAB from the date they
received the premium to the date six months after the policy incepted.
Thereafter, the accounting will be due every six months.  We have requested
this from AEGIS and will provide a statement to you when it is received.

Enron on the other hand is required to provide the following:

Page 4 of 13: IV. Definitions(i) Documents:

     Prior to each anniversary, INSURED
agrees to
     notify COMPANY of any material
change in the
     form of the agreements (ISDA,
Enfolio Master
     Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement, Master
Energy
     Purchase and Sale Agreement and
others which
     govern INSURED TRANSACTIONS).  The
     report shall consist of summary of
changes and
     red lined version of documents.

Page 7 of 13: VI. Conditions to Payment by the COMPANY(e)

INSURED:

     The INSURED hereby agrees to
promptly notify
     the COMPANY in writing of any
material changes
     in the process and procedures set
forth in the
     document titled XXXXXX (Credit
Procedures).

Page 7 of 13: VI. Conditions to Payment by the COMPANY (g)
     Report of Overdue Items:

     The INSURED shall remit a report to
the COMPANY
     no later than 45 days subsequent to
the end of each
     calendar month, a listing of all
past due amounts in
     excess of 60 days past due as of
that month-end
     date, which may be subject to
coverage hereunder.

Page 7 of 13: VII.  Settlement of Payments Due by the COMPANY
     or the INSURED (a):

     The INSURED shall provide to the
COMPANY within
     thirty (30) days after the end of
each half-year
     period a bordereau.....

Page 7 of 13: VII. Settlement of Payments Due by
     the COMPANY or the INSURED (c):

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
INSURED must
     notify the COMPANY in writing within
thirty (30)
     days after the INSURED first has
knowledge of
     any loss actually or potentially
subject to coverage
     under this policy....

There was some correspondence in October regarding the report of overdue
items (VI.(g)) and the bordereau (VII.(a)), both on page 7 of 13, however I
don't think that these reports have been generated.  We would appreciate
your assistance in obtaining these in order to provide them to AEGIS.
Additionally, we are obligated to provide underwriters with the revised
Credit Procedures and would appreciate an update on that process also.

Thank you for your assistance on these items.  Please let us know if you
have any questions or assist you in compiling these reports.

Thanks for the response.  As you heard from Cathy, I got a stomach virus and 
all 4 of us in the family spent Saturday night throwing up.  I am writing 
this from my bed and I am improving.  I should be able to get on the plane 
tomorrow and am about to eat lunch (1st meal since Sat. but I think it will 
be fine).  I'm definitely in recovery mode.

I am having everything messengered out to my house later this afternoon but 
am concerned about contacts and getting to the hotel.  I know you have said 
that it is easy to take the train and the bus but I am concerned about it, 
especially if i am still a little under the weather.  I still don't want to 
have a car, but would you please set up someone on your staff to meet me at 
the gate and escort me through the process.  Sorry if it is a pain but I

Thanks for the email.    I am looking forward to the trip and learning more 
about what you are doing thus how we can help.  If we would have had any idea 
that Europe could have been as big as it has become, we would have done some 
things differently and we can get a head start with Japan.  This would be 
most helpful.  We are clearly trying to avoid the traps that we ran into in 
Europe and in the US.  Faster, quicker, smarter.  Thursday sounds great and 
just let me know about Friday.  Is Anthony in japan during the trip?  Anthony 
was here last week and will be back the week after you arrive.  Remember,  I

applications just the business concepts and potential ideas and 
opportunities.  We clearly want your business insight wrt the setup and focus 
of the business.  I will send you a presentation that we recently gave to 
Sherriff.  It is mostly up to date although continually changing.  This will 
help give you a feeling for what the landscape looks like.  On Wed, however, 
I would like to take you through our web presentation and how this fits into 
our overall strategy.

A couple of other questions about the trip.  Do you want me to make any 
presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans?  I don't think 
presentations are necessary unless you would feel more comfortable or have 
something particularly appropriate.  The discussion with EPower/EJ on 
Thursday afternoon would be good if you could speak about Net Works and what 
Enron is doing across the focus areas.  On Friday, I believe that in the 
proposed meeting with Softbank a presentation is not necessary.  For the 
ACCJ, if you had a couple of slides on Enron and our e-comm initiatives this 
would be great.  We could put this together here if you would like as I have 
a couple of your recent presentations.  Let me know.  Also, what is the 
appropriate dress code.  The Japanese still dress up.  I'm afraid suits are 
de rigour.  I am assuming suits but i didn't want to make any assumptions 
about new cultures.  Do you have any cultural facts that you can fax me about 
the do's and don'ts of both cultures?  We could try and find something, but I 
think you will find that the Japanese are trying to become more western.  
Despite what you have heard, this place is not as foreign as rumored.  Do I 
have clear instruction how to take the train from the airport.  All of us get 
back and forth on the train and the bus.  We can get you a driver, but you 
won't get here any faster and is quite expensive (US$500 one way).  I 
normally get a driver, I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can't speak 
any of the language.  If there is a way to get lost, I'll find a way.

One more item, could you please have your assistant set up a message for me 
at the hotel.  I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it 
really helps.  Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel 
after the trip.  I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the 
Japanese culture.  Ono will set something set up here.  The hotel has its own 
massage service that can be accessed at almost all hours.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

We are looking to accomplish a number of things while you are here over 
Thursday and Friday.  Thursday's schedule is fairly set, and we are working 
on Friday.  Thursday morning through to the afternoon we would present to you 
the current state of the business and the initiatives/proposition/etc for 
enron.co.jp.  This would take us through mid afternoon.  We would then go 
over to EPower and we would ask you to give a talk on the state of technology 
at Enron and the initiatives within Net Works.  We would bring EJ over to 
EPower for your talk.  Afterwards we would have drinks with the main 
commercial team at EPower and EJ.  Dinner to be arranged for a smaller 
group.  On Friday, we would like to use the time to set up some meetings with 
key IT/tech companies here in Japan.  To date, we have not yet met any of 
these companies, but there is currently an extraordinary amount of activity 
in the country.  We are looking to leverage some of Enron's banking 
relationships to get as high a level meeting as possible with the likes of 
Softbank.  We are also asking for other suggestions from the banks.  We are 
also considering a potential talk with the American Chamber of Commerce on 
Enron and Enron Technology.  The ACCJ is one of the most active and largest 
chambers in the world and bring in some quite interesting speakers.  We will 
have more on this.

For the weekend we have recd some suggestions from the Hotel and will pass 
these along to you shortly.

I will be travelling with you on Sunday on the trip to Seoul.

Everything is all set for Korea but what do you suggest as an agenda for my 
two days in Tokyo?  Also are there some presentations or items that i could 
review before I arrive that you believe might be helpful?  I will also be 
there over a weekend, I would like to do some site seeing on Sat and Sunday 
(my flight to Korea leaves on Sunday late afternoon).  I would appreciate 
some suggestions and I will need a guide, could you have someone arrange it 
for me?

Thanks, and Cathy will co-ordinate everything.

chance of success.  First, Mission Energy is already a huge player in the 
IPP/Cogen business in Kern County, and is regarded as fairly skilled at 
getting permits/authorizations through the system.  Their existing facilites 
on Texaco's leases currently produce over 1,000 MW of power.  Secondly, this 
project would sit smack dab in the middle of the Midway-Sunset field and is 
easily accessible off the West Side Lateral of Kern/Mojave's system.  As 
such, they are probably a prime candidate for either Phase I or Phase II of 
Kern River's expansion.  Also, realize that Texaco has a substantial amount 
of field area [associated oil] gas, so, depending on the structure of the 
Texaco - Mission Energy sales agreement, Mission probably has access to or 
call on this Texaco production (i.e., they have the perfect physical hedge).

Kern would seem to be the ""pipeline of choice"" here... particularly, when you 
consider the impact of the reduced rates under their proposed expansion.  
Without the direct connection into Kern County, TW would have a difficult 
time competing.   Also, keep an eye out for El Paso moving forward with 
commercial plans for the California leg of All American Pipeline.  A large 
end-use plant like this could be the basis for an ""En-Rate"" type transport 
program on El Paso-All American, particularly if they get their allocation

Edison Mission Energy to build power plant in California

Edison Mission Energy, an Edison International company, is purchasing the
rights to the Sunrise Power Project from Texaco Power and Gasification. A
proposed power generation facility to be located in Kern County, Calif., the
project will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the
state, which is in dire need of new power generation.

The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-MW, simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to be in
service during the summer of 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking facility
to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of summer
2003.

Final regulatory approvals should be received shortly for Phase I of the
project. Edison Mission Energy plans to seek expedited permitting approval
for the Phase II expansion in line with the fast-track approvals process
recently enacted by the California legislature.

Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition,
construction management and operation of global power production facilities.
The company owns nearly 23,000 MW of generating capacity, including
interests in 75 projects currently under construction or operating in
Australia, Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand,
Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Business
Enron Plays The Pipes This old-time gas company is trading fuel for a future 
as a new-economy
superpower. Will the swap work?
Frank Gibney Jr./Houston

08/28/2000
Time Magazine
Time Inc.
38+
(Copyright 2000)

It's Saturday night, and the only thing between you and a movie from 
Blockbuster Video is the unpaid late fee for
last week's rental. If that sounds familiar, then you'll appreciate this: 
next year Blockbuster plans to offer up to 500
movie titles online in more than a dozen major cities around the U.S. That's 
right, video on demand (not the
frustrating no-rewind, no-pause pay-per-view offerings of today) for anyone 
with a DSL line at home. 

What's remarkable is that Blockbuster's partner happens to be an energy 
company called Enron. At a time when
so many old-economy companies seem helpless against the dizzying pace and 
technology of the digital age,
Enron is demonstrating why FORTUNE magazine keeps voting it the most 
innovative large company in America.
For years the Houston-based firm simply produced, transported and marketed 
natural gas. Then, as energy
deregulation threatened profit margins in the gas business, Enron discovered 
it could make billions by trading and
brokering packages of energy the way Midwesterners do pork bellies. Now Enron 
is moving into the
telecommunications business, with a national fiber-optic cable network and a 
floor bulging with Sun
supercomputers.

In fact, Enron may be the most interesting old-economy company around. Since 
moving its trading operations from
the phone to the Web eight months ago, the company has doubled revenues to 
more than $30 billion. Most of that
is made through trading everything from energy and paper to weather risk 
derivatives and now bandwidth--more than
800 offerings in all. Think of eBay, but instead of auctioning $5 used Baby 
Gap pajamas, the company trades
$600,000 blocks of natural gas--and pockets commensurately huge commissions. 
Boasts Enron president Jeffrey
Skilling: ""In terms of dollars transacted, we're the world's largest online 
site by a factor of 10."" 

So far this year, that has meant $120 billion in transactions. And when 
you're running the network, all sorts of
profitable opportunities arise. Last week, when word spread that natural-gas 
prices would spike this winter, Enron's
in-house traders saw their gains surge as customers raced to lock in future 
supplies at today's prices. And Enron's
stock price? It hit $90 last week, tripling its value of a year ago. Kind of 
like an Internet play, only better. 

The market loves Enron because Skilling and CEO Kenneth Lay seem to have come 
up with a business model that
works for just about anything. They provide a service to their customers by 
packaging a supply of name your
commodity and then using the efficiency of their vast network to beat most 
prices. They arrived at this model back
in the mid-1980s almost out of desperation, when crude-oil prices had 
collapsed, natural-gas deregulation had
thrown that market into chaos, and the Peruvian government had just 
nationalized Enron's offshore properties.
Figuring they might as well leverage deregulation instead of succumbing to 
it--call it business judo-- Skilling, a
McKinsey & Co. consultant at the time, came up with a plan called the Gas 
Bank, to buy up reserves of natural
gas, then package them for sale, with various prices and conditions for 
different customers. When electricity
markets deregulated a few years ago, the company did the same. It's the 
oldest concept in business: buy low, sell
high. 

Enron also leverages its assets and expertise to provide services to big 
customers. Since 1997, companies like
Owens Corning and Chase Manhattan Bank have signed long-term, 
multibillion-dollar contracts with Enron
subsidiary Enron Energy Services (EES) that lock in their energy costs for up 
to 10 years and provide Enron with a
steady revenue stream. What's more, Enron is beginning to actively manage its 
clients' heating and cooling plants,
installing new equipment when necessary and monitoring it all over the 
Internet. 

Skilling's latest gambit is to apply the same principles he learned in the 
power and energy sectors to making Enron
a leader in the booming telecommunications business. The plan isn't to go 
head to head with established fiber-optic
carriers such as AT&T, Qwest and Williams Communications. Instead, Enron 
wants to use new switching
technology and its expertise in trading pipeline access to transform a modest 
telecom network into a powerful
arbiter of bandwidth. Enron's bet is simple: supply and demand will increase 
exponentially, turning bandwidth into a
tradable commodity, just like gas and electricity. Along the way, why not 
partner with companies such as
Blockbuster and use this new technology to offer content--like movies- -and 
blow it through existing, underutilized
pipe? ""They are jump- starting an application [telecom content] with a 
potential market of $200 billion a year,"" says
Tom Nolle, president of the telecom consulting firm CIMI. 

Other new-economy players are also beginning to see the power merchant as a 
prize partner. IBM and AOL have
joined with Enron to form the New Power Co. (TNPC), an independent start-up 
that will offer pricing schemes and a
choice of power and gas service for residential and small-business customers. 
Enron provides the electricity; AOL
enables customers to buy it via the Web; and IBM takes care of the billing. 
""It's ludicrous that we're in the 21st
century, and you still have people jumping over fences to read meters,"" says 
Skilling, pointing out that the
technology exists to offer real-time pricing for gas and electricity. In 
deregulated markets, TNPC will allow
consumers to switch power companies as easily as they do phone companies. 

Despite all Wall Street's enthusiasm for Enron's bold plans, there are still 
plenty of skeptics. Critics point out that
there is barely a market today for the company's bandwidth trading exchange. 
They also stress that pushing digital
signals through pipe is a world away from routing natural gas. Although there 
is plenty of cable across the country,
carriers are not set up to mix and match access to it. ""It's a very, very 
difficult concept,"" says Nolles. Even the
Blockbuster venture is risky: technology aside, there is also the highly 
political question of digital rights. How do
you satisfy Hollywood that its content is secure? 

But Skilling and his lieutenants are quick to counter that everyone thought 
they were crazy to try to make markets
in gas and electricity. And Enron, after all, is a company that thrives on 
entrepreneurial defiance of convention.
Many of its new ventures were started because managers simply set new ideas 
in motion without waiting for
approval from the top. Even the online operation was cobbled together in a 
mere seven months. Skilling and Lay
found out about EnronOnline only two weeks before it went live. 

Is taking risks really a part of a gas-pipeline company's culture? Just ask 
John Arnold, the 26-year-old chief of
natural-gas derivatives, who after nine hours and $1 billion in trades last 
Wednesday had this to say: ""You can't turn
away for a minute or you get picked off."" That has happened to too many 
traditional companies because they were
unable to find a niche in the new economy. Enron, however, has traded its way 
into a starring role, and now it
hopes it is ready for the movies.

Vince,

FEA has arrived at a very simple, direct, and inexpensive approach to
licensing our two VaR-related patents as a package.  I hope that you will
agree that our proposed license fee of $2,500 plus $1 per employee, with
licenses to go to all of your affiliates, would be an attractive offer.  I
would love to sign up Enron for this package as an early customer.  Do you
think you could forward the attached pdf license agreement to the
appropriate people at Enron, together with your recommendation? I am highly
motivated to get Enron as a licensee, and I strongly believe that it will be
a worthwhile effort for both parties.

Best regards,

Hi Christie,

when do you sleep? 2 am, ugh!

ok,  you were correct, my invitation was to those people within Enron that 
the students talked with before interviewing competitors, and it was an 
invitation to the presentation only.  I didn't think any of them would be 
invited to the dinner, and probably none will even come to the presentation.  
The invitation did elicit one request for the final report though, so maybe 
it wasn't a complete waste.  

I didn't realize that the dinner had turned into a box visit.  that sounds 
great.  I wish the group could have made it to dinner before the first game, 
that would have made the whole slumming experience better.  Now they'll get 
the royal treatment at Enron Field.  It'll be great.

Vince invited 4 people from Rice:

Dennis W. Loughridge, Director of Energy Consortium; lounghrid@rice.edu
Carrie Miller, Director of MBA Program; cmiller@rice.edu
Deborah Barrett, Inst. Communications, barrett@rice.edu
Dr. Wil Uecker, Associate Dean for Executive Education,uecker@rice.edu

Loughridge wrote back saying he'll come, I don't know about the others

Here are the 6 students emails:

""Ritwik \(Ronnie\) Ghosh"" <ghoshr@rice.edu>, ""Ivy Ghose"" <ghosei@rice.edu>, 
""Luigi Calabrese"" <luigical@rice.edu>, ""Pravas Sud"" <pravas@rice.edu>, ""Syed 
\(Farhan\) Iqbal"" <iqbal@rice.edu> 
<cwomack@rice.edu>

your 2 from Rice makes a total of 12 from Rice, I guess

let me know if you would like me to do anything else related to Monday
look forward to seeing you then

political leaders and our response to that comeback.  He says he hasn't spent

I've attached our comments on Mary's analysis of the PX's authority re: the 
Silver Peak Line investigation.  As you will see, we agree with Mary's 
analysis, subject to minor quibbles that do not affect the conclusion, that 
EPMI should not be found to have violated the literal terms of the PX's 
tariff, that the PX has no sanction authority over this matter, and that 
publication of the Compliance Unit's findings would be inappropriate.

We would, however, take a harder line on the proposed compromise.  In our 
view, we should insist that the PX never publicly link EPMI to the events of 
Mary 24-25.  Thus, we should agree to support a tariff filing by the PX to 
clean-up the loophole in its tariff revealed by these events, as long as the 
tariff filing does not mention either EPMI or these events as the basis for 
the filing.

Richard,

Rob has asked for some input on the proposed Draft Hague Convention relating 
to jurisdiction and the enforcement of foreign judgments.   One of the new 
proposals could have implications for trading.   The proposal would arguably 
subject a company to suit in a jurisdiction where it has an accessible 
website for conducting e-commerce.   However, under the Convention this grant 
of jurisdiction would apparently (I am still studying this) be overridden by 
a contractually-agreed forum selection clause.  Do our current e-business 
contracts contain a forum selection clause?  Would you anticipate that we 
would conduct trades in the future without a previously-agreed forum 
selection clause?

Thanks for your help.

Once again, I come to you for help.  We were awarded a biosolids dewatering 
contract in Grand Rapids, Michigan about a month ago.  We had bid against the 
incumbent, a company called Synagro.  You may recall that Azurix is in 
litigation with Syangro over a busted acquisition, but the two events are not 
related.  In any case, we were low bidder, and the recommendation was made to 
award the contract to us.  Synagro has been working to get the award 
overturned, and appears to have been successful.  It is not yet clear whether 
they are going to award the deal to Synagro, or re-bid.  It is not even clear 
what the grounds are for overturning the award, which indicates that it may 
be pure politics.  

Do we have any good political consultants that could help us in Grand 
Rapids?  We do not have much of a presence in that area, and were responding 
to a publicly advertised bid.  Price and technical qualifications were the 
only issues.  Politics did not enter into it until now, so we were caught a 
little flat-footed.   

Any suggestions?

I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research 
Group,
is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of 
talent we have currently
in London.
Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time
to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.


My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader, 
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy 
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.

His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value 
technical
skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the 
same caliber
as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to 
Houston
for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a 
sufficient
incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has 
greatly improved.

Please, let me know what you think.

Sara and I met with Mark today to talk in part about the concerns I had about 
the HDD info that third parties had requested us to provide.  He wants us to 
talk to you and the group further about this because there are risks 
associated with us giving this info to third parties if a portion of such 
info is info that we fill in based on our internal knowledge.  I'm out 
tomorrow and this afternoon is hectic so I would very much like to have this 
discussion at our Monday morning meeting.  does everyone on your side know 
about the meeting at 10:30 and can they attend?  If that time is a problem,

but we should still try to get to the bottom of this because we will be 
called on to comment to regulators and media.  Unless we have strong evidence 
to the contrary, it seems to me that wholesale markets are working .... they 
are open and they are competitive.  On the other hand, retail gas markets 
suffer from the same problems as electric markets ... they are not open, 
customers don't have effective choices and price signals don't get through, 
so there is no demand response when prices rise.  

On the points raised in the attachment, I'm still not sure I follow point 4.  
Also what does"" electric disconnect"" mean?

Leslie:  Looks good.  Just a couple of comments:

1. General
May want to point out that the roots of California's current gas woes are the 
same ones causing the electric problem---combined effect of California's 
""import-based"" energy policy and the state's failure to invest in in-state 
infrastructure.  California imports about 25% of its electricity, but about 
80-90 percent of its gas supply.  California has failed to invest in the 
in-state infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the 
last decade.  So we've got an interstate pipeline superhighway to the border 
and a dirt road of in-state transportation once you get into California.
The last bullet seems to suggest that manipulation may be taking place.  Can 
we support that suggestion, and is it one that we want to make necessarily?  
If we do suggest that manipulation may in part explain current prices, do we 
need to propose ways to eliminate it?  Otherwise, seems that we may be giving 
FERC ammunition to take action without trying to ""steer"" that action in the 
right direction.  Maybe I'm reading too much into the bullet.

2. Specific
Competition for gas coming to California has increased significantly.  The 
midwest (via Alliance) is competing away Canadian gas.  The Southwest 
(Nevada, Arizona) is competing away supply from the Southwest before it hits 
the California border.

Subject: CFTC Reauthorization

At his request, I met Lee Sachs, Assistant Treasury Secretary, who had 
requested the meeting after a brief conversation recently.  Lee said that 
senior-level negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week 
between the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock 
futures issue (the major issue postponing movement of the legislation).  

As you know, the House completed committee work on HR 4541 before it 
recessed.  The bill will now is pending before the Rules Committee where 
differences will be worked out between the three different Committee versions 
(Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking).  The Senate Agriculture Committee 
passed out the Senate version in July.  However, the bill is not moving 
quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramm's desire to see significant 
changes made to the legislation (not directly related to our energy 
language). Last week at the Republican Convention, I asked the Senator about 
the bill and he said they were working on it, but much needs to be changed 
for his support.  More telling perhaps, were Wendy Gramm's comments that she 
would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year.  
What this means is that we must, at the least, remove Senator Gramm's 
opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain 
his support of the legislation.

Lee Sachs message was just that.  I told Lee that we shared his desire to 
move the legislation as long as it contains a full exclusion for all 
non-agriculture commodities (including metals).  He said that we would have a 
difficult time defending the metals provision politically. But, Lee said  ""we 
would not find Treasury opposition to the House Commerce Committee language"" 
(which includes favourable language on energy and metals).   This is a 
positive development, because it isolates the CFTC from its key defenders and 
I hope ensures no veto threat on our issues.  However, I do not expect 
Treasury to be vocal in support of our position.  It is clear that 
Congressional leaders and the Administration want to get this bill done this 
year and there remains a good opportunity for enactment.

However, with less than 20 or so legislative days left, we need Senator Gramm 
to engage.  A call from Ken Lay in the next two weeks to Senator Gramm could 
be an impetus for Gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences.  Gramm 
needs to fully understand how helpful the bill is to Enron.  Let me know your 
thoughts on this approach.   I am prepared to assist in coordinating the call 
and drafting the talking points for a Ken Lay/Sen. Gramm call.

		 Subject: Wall Street Journal Article - Regarding SPR Oil

As most of you know, Enron had some discussions with Euell Energy regarding 
SPR oil.  We ultimately were unable to do any deal with Mr. Euell and 
subsequently, he publicly blamed us for his inability to complete a deal.  
Attached is an article from the Wall Street Journal.  Mark Palmer, Steve Kean 
and I spent most of Friday trying to kill the story.  In addition to numerous 
conversations, we even played tapes of the final three phone calls between 
Mr. Euell and our trader.  While we were unable to kill the story completely, 
we are pleased with the outcome.  If you have any questions, please call me 
at ext. 3-9053.




A Trio of Little Guys
Embarks on Wild Ride
In Global Oil Market
---
Pursuing Business With DOE,
Their Paths Diverge; One
Leads to `a Lot of Money' 
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John Fialka in Denver, Alexei 
Barrionuevo in Tallahassee, Fla., and Jonathan Weil in New York 
? 
10/16/2000 
The Wall Street Journal 
Page A1 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Lance Stroud of New York, Renard D. Euell of Denver and Ronald Peek of 
Tallahassee, Fla., all had dreams of becoming oil barons. And on Oct. 4, when 
the Department of Energy announced the results of the bidding for oil from 
the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, they thought their ships had come 
in. 
Two of the three black entrepreneurs were unknowns in the industry, and none 
of them had ever done a major oil deal. But there they were, listed as 
winning bidders alongside some of the biggest names in the business -- 
Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., BP Amoco 
PLC and Amerada Hess Corp. Each would be given the right to withdraw millions 
of barrels of oil from the reserve amid one of the most volatile oil markets 
in decades. In exchange, each had offered to replace that oil, plus an 
additional amount akin to an interest payment, a year later. They and the 
other winning bidders, the Energy Department said, were picked soley because 
they pledged to return the biggest quantities of oil to the reserve. 
There was just one catch: In its rush to release the oil and so ease a price 
crunch, the Energy Department had suspended its usual requirement that each 
bidder supply financial guarantees. But it wanted the winning bidders to 
present letters of credit, equal to the oil's market value, five days after 
their bids were submitted. The big players could easily meet that 
requirement. But Messrs. Stroud, Euell and Peek were men of limited means. 
They needed to find someone willing to back them for tens of millions of 
dollars -- and fast. 
The drama made for an unaccustomed scene in Harlem, where the 35-year-old Mr. 
Stroud lived with his 74-year-old mother. A heavy-set man with a goatee, Mr. 
Stroud, a former Army enlisted man who had dropped out of college shy of 
graduation, had held a string of odd jobs while using the Internet to seek 
out a big business deal. 
The aspiring oil man had entered his bid for four million barrels from the 
reserve, via the Internet. He won't discuss the details of his bid, but says 
he thought he could outbid the large oil companies because he didn't have as 
much overhead. After the winning bids were announced, Mr. Stroud became 
something of a celebrity. TV news crews arrived to interview his neighbors, 
many of whom had no idea what all the fuss was about. ""I thought he [Mr. 
Stroud] was some kind of rap star,"" recalls Carline Thomas, who lives down 
the hall from him. 
As neighbors paused to shoot the breeze on the steps of nearby residential 
buildings, most marred by graffiti, Wall Street couriers bearing fat packets 
of information spent the week scurrying back and forth from Mr. Stroud's 
apartment on a seedy block in Harlem's central business district. 
Inside Mr. Stroud's apartment, the telephone wouldn't stop ringing, and his 
mother was helping him field the calls. He says he was in serious talks with 
four companies. And a movie producer was interested in his life story. Then, 
amid the chaos, tragedy struck. On Tuesday night, his mother, Iris Manning, 
suffered a cardiac arrest, and was taken to a hospital a few blocks south of 
Mr. Stroud's apartment. 
Mr. Stroud said he spent most of Wednesday running between his apartment and 
the hospital, taking occasional phone calls to deal with prospective 
financiers. Ms. Manning went into cardiac arrest three more times, and died 
at 9:47 p.m. Wednesday evening. 
Mr. Stroud was dazed by the fact that what he called the two biggest events 
of his life -- the death of his mother and his selection by the Energy 
Department -- occurred almost simultaneously. ""I'm saying `there must be some 
reason I'm here,' "" he said later. ""These things happening like this, the 
odds must be in the millions."" 
Mr. Stroud won't discuss which companies were vying for his oil, but he says 
at one point he thought he had an offer to buy him out for $1.50 a barrel, or 
$6 million. The most serious discussions began Thursday, with a 
representative from a refining company, which he refuses to name. From that 
discussion Thursday until the following evening, Mr. Stroud says, he was 
confident that the refiner would grant him the letter of credit he needed. 
But at 9 p.m. Friday, three hours before his deadline, Mr. Stroud said he got 
a call telling him the deal was off. ""I was upset,"" he says. ""I mean, instead 
of wasting my time with that I could have obtained the financing quickly"" 
from some other source. 
A spokesman for Koch Industries Inc., based in Wichita, Kan., said it was in 
negotiations with both Messrs. Euell and Stroud. ""We invited them to make a 
deal that made economic sense."" BP Amoco said it also had discussions with 
Mr. Stroud. 
Mr. Stroud now says the DOE should have given him an extension, under the 
circumstances. ""If your mother passes, aren't you given three days to 
grieve?"" Mr. Stroud asks. His mother's funeral is scheduled for Wednesday, 
which would have been her 75th birthday, he says. 
Mr. Euell ran a small company, Euell Energy Resources, whose 12 employees 
helped him broker natural-gas sales and other small energy deals. By night, 
he worked the phones from his home in a modest Denver suburb, calling oil 
producers in Nigeria and energy brokers in Singapore and Sydney, always 
looking for the big score that would make him rich. 
A friend, Norman Early, a sometime golfing partner and a former Denver U.S. 
district attorney, says the 50-year-old Mr. Euell is ""one of those guys who 
shoots for the stars."" On Oct. 4, Mr. Euell thought he had hit one. He had 
been awarded the right to withdraw three million barrels of oil from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in exchange for returning 3.3 million barrels a 
year later. That was enough oil to fill 14,019 conventional tank trucks. 
Knowing he would need a partner to provide financial backing, Mr. Euell had 
already placed a call to a man he'd never met: Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and 
chief executive of Enron Corp. He said he was sure he was going to be one of 
the top bidders for the reserve oil. Would Enron like to be his partner? 
Within a few hours John Nolan, the giant energy company's vice president in 
charge of trading, called from London. Enron , he said, was interested. 
By Oct. 6, the price of oil had already fallen, making Mr. Euell's bid look 
generous. Still, he felt bullish. ""I'm betting on Mother Nature, that she's 
coming back this winter and that oil's going to be more valuable."" 
It wasn't Mother Nature, but the crisis in the Middle East that turned things 
around. Monday, Oct. 9, the target price for November oil futures on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange, jumped a dollar to $31.86 a barrel and headed 
higher. Mr. Euell flew to Houston and took a room at the Hyatt Regency, from 
which he could see Enron 's 50-story office tower. 
By Tuesday, the price of oil had hit $33.18. By Mr. Euell's calculations that 
meant a $3 million profit for him and an equal amount for his prospective 
partner just across the street. Enron 's lawyers were working on an agreement 
that would substitute Enron as the major party in Mr. Euell's contract, he 
said, and were drawing up the letter of credit for $93 million that the DOE 
required. 
Eager to close the deal, Mr. Euell called Enron trader Patrick Danaher, who 
was working on the project. ""I want to sign this thing up today,"" Mr. Euell 
told him, claiming that he had received an offer from another, unnamed firm, 
offering to buy his contract for $1.2 million. According to tapes of the 
conversation provided by Enron , Mr. Danaher said the paperwork was under 
way: ""Let me see if we can do that today."" 
Mr. Euell called backed at 11:30 a.m. and again at 11:45 a.m. Each time, the 
trader sounded more pessimistic. Prospects were ""50-50."" When Mr. Euell 
suggested he had other offers, Mr. Danaher told him: ""If you have a bid at 
$1.2 million, you should take it. A bird in the hand is worth two in the 
bush. I just have to tell you that."" Still, he invited Mr. Euell to dinner. 
Tuesday's deadline passed without dinner or any action from Enron . While it 
appears from the tapes that the parties had been close to an accord, Eric 
Thode, a spokesman for Enron 's trading branch, says: ""At no time was there 
anything remotely resembling a deal with Mr. Euell."" 
Mr. Euell got the DOE to agree to extend the deadline for another 24 hours 
and, after a round of frantic phone calls, says he collected pledges from a 
group of European banks to support the $93 million letter of credit. But, 
when the new deadline expired, he still had failed to get the proper 
paperwork to the DOE, which then declared his award to have lapsed. ""They 
played me,"" Mr. Euell complains, blaming Enron for the missed deadlines. 
Still, he says, the experience amounted to an instant ""Ph.D."" in oil. Next 
time, he vows, he will have his own letter of credit. 
The DOE said late last week that it will accept new bids on the seven million 
barrels of oil Messrs. Stroud and Euell forfeited. 
As for Mr. Peek, he remains the mystery man of the three. His company, 
Burhany Energy Industries Inc., was formed Aug. 21. It employs no one but Mr. 
Peek himself. Staffers at the Florida Black Business Investment Board, where 
Mr. Peek works as a business-development specialist, said he had taken last 
week off. Shutters were drawn at his modest, one-story house in Tallahassee. 
Phone calls to Mr. Peek were forwarded to an unidentified neighbor. In an 
e-mail to a reporter, Mr. Peek apologized for being unreachable. He was 
""working relentlessly to consummate this transaction"" and couldn't ""entertain 
any distraction at the moment."" 
On Saturday, the Department of Energy announced that Mr. Peek had 
successfully transferred his interest in three million barrels of government 
oil to Hess Energy Trading Co. of New York, a partnership that includes 
Amerada Hess. Amerada Hess Vice President Carl Tursi said he could give few 
details of the deal, except to say that he believes there was an 
""arrangement"" that resulted in ""a lot of money"" for Mr. Peek.

Subject: Re: using new FF vols  

Hi, John,
following up the discussion with you on Friday we talked with Risk Control 
people who are not excited to use that FF vol curve
you sent to me. Also in order to use your curves we would have to have them 
for all the locations.
The suggested alternative solution was to calculate the Forward Forward vol 
curves from historical data.
I implemented this solution based on 18 last business days forward price 
curves for NG and 
all basis locations. I used exponential weights with 0.97 decay factor.
I enclose these curves in the spreadsheet below. And here are the VAR numbers 
based on these curves:

     5/30/00  5/31/00
AGG-STORAGE (production) 3,027,000  4,516,000
AGG-STORAGE (test, 0.97)  2,858,543  3,011,761
AGG-GAS        (production) 36,627,200  40,725,685
AGG-GAS       (test, 0.97)  29,439,969  31,207,225

You see that the numbers are stable, lower than the official numbers. 
I suggest that we use 0.94 decay factor as recommended by Risk Metrics which 
would give more weight to recent data.
We need to test this approach for a period of time and also to collect 
backtesting data for an educated choice of decay factor.

Tanya.

In true ""swedish hostage syndrome"" fashion, Smutney informed us that none of 
IEP's members has screamed about the FERC-proposed cap.  He added that the 
""industry"" is under siege and that ""just saying no"" to price caps isn't 
politically tenable.  He also said that he hadn't planned on mentioning price 
caps in his remarks.  We expressed concern that it would be hard for the head 
of California's generator association to avoid the topic.

We stressed the importance of having IEP disagree with FERC's cap proposal 
and offered the following message points:

Price caps have failed in the past and they'll fail again.
FERC's and California's immediate goal ought to be to make the bold reforms 
necessary to create real, competitive markets and eliminate the need for 
price caps altogether.
The most important reforms include:
Reforming California's siting laws to permit entry of supply---best way to 
undermine ""high"" prices is easy entry by competitors
Reforming the PUC review of utility purchases
Give the utilities financial incentives to purchase efficiently (i.e., 
similar to California's gas market, where a benchmark is set and the IOUs 
profit or lose on the basis of whether the IOU does better or worse than the 
benchmark).  It ain't rocket science, and it works.  
The CPUC gets out of the way and stops the practice of ""after-the-fact"" 
reviews of power purchases.
Creating a retail market
If California/FERC adopt these reforms, the need for caps will vanish.
FERC got a lot right in the order, but the price cap proposal is flawed.
Price is too low to incent development of peakers---well-functioning, 
efficient markets require peakers.
Information disclosure provisions are too costly and unnecessary.
Disincents energy efficiency.
IEP written comments will offer suggestions on how to remedy the flaws in the 
proposed cap.

Smutney was comfortable with these points and is open to hearing more from us 
today and tomorrow.  If folks have comments on these points, or have others 
we should discuss with Smutney, don't hesitate.

Best,

Subject: Suggestions for Floor Meeting Locations

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  
Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 
employees in the Enron building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of 
the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule 
one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this 
segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees 
per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of 
operations employees):  

  29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, 
settlements and EIM risk 

  30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various 
products) 

  31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., 
settlements and DPR           and MPR teams
  
  32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions), 
operational analysis

     
  37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global 
services       
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative ""newcomer"" to Enron 
Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would 
be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it 
easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally

Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California
 Utilities: Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations 
swelled and few new energy sources were developed. Now, also facing 
blackouts, they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and 
toward themselves.


By PETER G. GOSSELIN, Times Staff Writer


     WINTERSBURG, Ariz.--For more than a century, California ran a simple 
account with the rest of the West: It demanded and the West supplied, most 
especially water and power.
     But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decade--in no small 
part because of an outbound trek of Californians--this simple, supply-demand 
relationship has broken down.
     Fundamentally, the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system 
just as California has its own. And it has done so in very much the same 
way--by adding too many people without enough new power or conservation.
     Indeed, statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have 
been on the verge of trouble even without California's help and may yet face 
the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden 
State.
     The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that 
its planning reserves--the extra power that utilities build in to handle 
emergencies--have shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts 
consider dangerous.
     Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production 
at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade. 
Despite the long economic boom of the 1990s, which smiled especially on the 
West, several, such as Arizona, have failed to complete a single new power 
plant.
     ""We don't know how bad it's going to be yet,"" said Utah's Republican 
governor, Mike Leavitt. ""We won't know that until May, June, July and August, 
when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers.""
     In trying to dodge the blackout bullet, many Western leaders are seeking 
to force a great change on the region: to renegotiate their states' basic 
deal with California. They want to end an old relationship--that between 
center and hinterland, colonizer and colonized--and establish a new one that 
could curtail California's long regional dominance.
     In the strange chemistry of the moment--when a once-Republican state 
government has turned Democratic and a once-Democratic national government 
has turned Republican, when the battle is to a large extent over privately 
owned electricity rather than publicly controlled water--they could actually 
meet with some success.
     ""California spent the 20th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street 
and the East,"" said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a 
multivolume history of California. ""Now, all of a sudden, there's a dramatic 
possibility of it being recolonized, at least in part, by the rest of the 
West.""

     Captive Plants Feed Power to California
     Ground zero for these changes lies 50 miles west of Phoenix in the dry 
scrublands of Wintersburg. This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility, 
now the nation's single biggest power producer. It will soon be home as well 
to between three and six new gas-fired power plants that, combined, will 
produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor.
     Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old, fraying world of 
regulated utilities and about the supply-demand relationships that California 
once maintained with the rest of the West.
     More than one-quarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles' municipal 
utility, the Department of Water and Power, several other California cities 
and Southern California Edison.
     A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California, carrying a 
transmission line from plant to consumer. California has big stakes in a 
half-dozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New 
Mexico.
     From California's point of view, the beauty of these projects has been 
that they provided near-certain power without the muss of meeting state 
pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home.
     And at least until the mid-1990s, California regulators virtually 
guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits, even if 
plants' power wasn't immediately needed.
     ""The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to 
meet demand, no matter what,"" said Paul L. Joskow, a veteran utility 
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
     ""If you had too much power, if it cost you a little too much, that was 
less important than being sure you could meet demand."" And, he added, ""you 
had regulators watching to make sure you did.""
     The gas-fired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also 
representative, but of the new, deregulated world of power production. 
Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same 
California transmission line, they are being built on an entirely different 
business premise: selling power to the highest bidder.
     In fact, the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an 
electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself, but its huge 
transmission lines. In addition to the California line, four others fan out 
from the plant: two back to Phoenix, one east to New Mexico, and one north to 
Utah and from there to the Northwest.
     All were built to hard-wire the nuclear project to its owners. But they 
are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar 
by sending power wherever prices are highest.
     ""It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the 
market to see if they could meet demand,"" said Jack Davis, president of 
Pinnacle West Capital Corp., which owns Arizona's major utility and is 
putting up two of the Wintersburg plants.
     ""Now,"" he said approvingly, ""it's being built by people who look at the 
market to see if you can make a lot of money.""

     Plans Go Awry in Many States
     Money, not the watchful eye of government, was what was supposed to 
assure that electricity deregulation worked. The opportunity to make it would 
cause investors to flock to the electricity business, ensuring that plenty of 
new power plants got built.
     If too many went up, it would be investors, not ratepayers, who 
suffered. If too few, then high prices would attract still more investors, 
more plants and, ultimately, more power.
     But to date, almost nothing about deregulation has gone as planned--and 
not just in California, but in the West in general.
     Take Arizona. The state has a hands-off attitude toward business, 
including its utilities. It has almost none of the environmental restrictions 
blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs.
     Its population grew by 40% from 1990 to 2000, according to the Census 
Bureau. And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate, 
according to industry figures.
     ""Arizona should have been a power producer's heaven,"" said A. Michael 
Schaal, a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc., a prominent 
Washington-area consulting firm.
     But Arizona's power production rose a mere 4% during the 1990s, mostly 
as a result of improving existing plants. Until 18 months ago, no one had 
applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late 1980s.
     ""I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort 
of 10-, 20-, 30-year time horizon,"" Arizona's Republican Gov. Jane Dee Hull 
said in a recent interview. ""I think what we all worry about is: Are they 
planning?""
     Or Nevada. Its utilities apparently did plan and increased 
electricity-making capacity between 1990 and 2000 by a substantial 44%. But 
that wasn't enough to keep up with the state's population, which increased 
66%. On Thursday, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican and former energy 
company executive, indefinitely halted deregulation in his state.
     Or traditionally energy-rich Washington state. One of its major 
utilities, Seattle City Light, recently learned that all of its previously 
planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed, and then 
some, by just three new customers: computer server farms being built to 
handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the high-tech capital.
     But it's unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional 
supplies are balanced on a ""razor's edge,"" according to Northwest Power Pool 
President Jerry Rust. ""We have no cushion.""
     Indeed, the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a 
razor's edge, with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this 
summer.
     Schaal, the Washington-area consultant, for example, said the region 
will come up 6% short. ""Westerners can expect 150 to 275 hours of rolling 
blackouts, most of them in California,"" he said.
     One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that, in 
contrast to what most people think, supplies have not grown short just 
recently.
     They have been perilously tight for the last several years--before the 
start of California's troubles of this summer and fall, and before the 
near-record dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water 
for its hydroelectric dams.
     The implication is that California did not cause other states to run 
short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger. It did 
that, according to key observers, with one monumentally inept maneuver.
     When California required its major utilities to buy power in the 
volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along 
higher costs to consumers, it set off a furious price spiral.
     That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security 
blanket, the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively 
if local supplies proved inadequate.
     The result has been a string of crises across the West.
     In southern Arizona, for example, the San Carlos Irrigation Project, a 
tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by 
dropping long-term contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the 
spot market, has announced that its bills are going up 300%. Most of the 
project's 13,300 poor customers say they can't pay.
     In Phoenix, utility executives who had confidently said the state was 
rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two 
50-year-old steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable 
generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market.
     In Idaho, the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip 
planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps 
back to the firm. Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than 
purchasing power on the open market--and the potato farmers are likely to do 
pretty well themselves.

     Deep Hostility in Rest of the West
     The subtle difference between California's triggering recent events and 
actually causing the region's crisis is largely lost in the current 
atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval. Although leaders of the rest of the 
West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big 
neighbor, they are less guarded at home.
     The normally mild-mannered Leavitt, for example, was recently quoted as 
warning a Salt Lake City audience that ""California, if given the chance, 
would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly."" (In an 
interview, he denied having made the remark.)
     Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners 
that their states are, in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto, ""plundered 
provinces""--terrain that first Easterners and then Californians have 
regularly raided for minerals, water and, most recently, power.
     But this time, some Western leaders think they can change all this. ""A 
lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with 
California to their advantage,"" said Stanford historian Richard White.
     The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West.
     In the Northwest, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana are redoubling 
their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration, the huge, 
federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that 
is one of California's chief sources of summer electricity. 
     ""The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the 
region can be exported without the region's consent,"" Oregon Gov. John 
Kitzhaber said in an interview.
     In Arizona, state officials have gone from having no proposals for new 
power plants to being buried by them. Regulators recently approved the 
construction of 10 plants, including several around Palo Verde, and are 
considering another eight.
     Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizona's 
needs first, the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for 
whatever prices they can command, an arrangement that could leave California 
just one among many bidders.
     (Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way: Gov. Hull is close to 
President Bush, who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic 
California.)
     Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah, 
where Leavitt is trying something that could become California's worst 
nightmare--recalling power that Utah produces for the state.
     Los Angeles' DWP and several other California utilities own 
three-quarters of the huge, coal-fired Intermountain Power Project in 
west-central Utah, and have been drawing on it without incident for 15 years.
     But Utah officials recently unearthed a long-forgotten provision in 
their agreement with the plant's owners that gives them the right, with 
proper notice, to recall power for local use.
     The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back 50 
megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another 170 next summer, 
and it may be able to take back still more, according to plant general 
manager Reed Searle.
     Although the amounts are trivial--the Los Angeles utility either owns or 
has firm contracts for more than 7,000 megawatts of capacity--Leavitt said 
Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants 
in the state, including a 500- to 750-megawatt facility that Los Angeles is 
negotiating to build.
     ""California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has 
depended on us to do that,"" the Utah governor said. ""That's fine and we're 
willing to do that.
     ""But,"" he added, ""there comes a point at which, if demand grows too 
large, we've got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves, and for 
our children and grandchildren.""
     If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point, California 
could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which 
it now suffers.

Sara - please review and offer your comments.

RAC - I need a Sigma Factor, please.

William - I have built a test Product in the Product Manager and it appears 
to have worked okay. I have asked David Forster to review the description as 
well as the attributes that I built in TEST. I will begin to build this in 
Production once I have his and Sara's sign-off. David will also be checking 
on the issue that I mentioned to you about the number of characters that can 
be put in the Volume and Price feilds in the Stack Manager. This is the one 
thing that could really hold up the process, so we may want to think about 
alternatives (such as trading in 10,000 increments - so that 5 means 50,000; 
50 means 500,000; etc) 

Jennifer Denney will be contacting Clara Carrington to talk to her about how 
Clara will see trades come over in the EOL Bridge Monitor.

Things are progessing relatively well so far, with the exception of the issue 
of the character limitation.

Hi Catherine,

I don't remember who actually gives the notice, but in anticipation of the 
funding of the escrow tomorrow, here are the docs.



I understand there is also a two day notice.  I don't believe I've seen a 
form for that one yet.

Who should send this out tomorrow after we get the fed ref?

Subject: Online LNG Trading

Hopefully Brunei LNG/Shell won't beat us to the punch.  You can bet that Mr. 
Damit at Brunei LNG gets his intelligence from Shell who no doubt are working 
on this already
(Shell is in a JV that just rolled out an online shipping capacity/freight 
trading business this month).
The first one to launch an LNG Trading internet platform will have an 
incredible advantage over all others.
  
Dan


06:19 GMT  14 September 2000  

PATTAYA, Thailand (Dow Jones)--Online liquefied natural gas trading is on the 
way and will challenge the way business in the industry is done, 
Mohammed Damit, head of LNG marketing for Brunei LNG Sdn Bhd, said this week 
at a gathering of gas industry executives. 

""It's only a matter of time before we see energy trading activities on the 
net,"" Damit said, adding that the biggest LNG online opportunities are
in ship chartering and spot LNG trading. 

Damit said online trading would result in greater price volatility. 

LNG prices are currently indexed to crude oil prices, in term contracts for 
as long as 20-30 years, that tend to smooth out price fluctuations 
over the life of the contract. 

Damit added that online traders will use standardized documents, simplifying 
trading.

Subject: Stone and Webster/Black & Veatch/Other Development Agreements

Attached are Turbo Park and accounting ""approved"" forms of the Technical 
Design Services Agreement between FPRP and Stone & Webster ( TDSA) and the 
Agreement for Professional Engineering Services between FPRP and Black & 
Veatch ( B&V Agreement). Each form has to now be fashioned to reflect the 
business deal/payment terms/etc. Note that the Scope of Work on the TDSA 
underwent substantial modification to conform with 97-10 requirements, and 
the attached draft Scope of Work only deals with the Facility ( as defined in 
the TDSA ), and not the ""improvements"" ( which term was included in the draft 
Tasking Letter from which the Scope of Work was fashioned).I assume we will 
need to ""clone"" this TDSA except for a different Scope of Work description to 
deal with such ""improvements"" other than the Facility ( ie, I assume these 
are the King Plant improvements).

The TDSA is calculated to put as much of the Turbo Park-approved EPC in front 
of Stone & Webster at the earliest possible date, so that the amendment and 
restatement of the TDSA to make it a full blown Turbo Park EPC Contract will 
be more straightforward. Right now, it is contemplated FPRP would assign its 
interests as Construction Manager under the TDSA to ENA, and the TDSA would 
be concurrently amended and restated as set forth above, both at the time the 
FPRP goes into Phase II of Turbo Park. At the time FPRP goes into Phase I of 
Turbo Park, I believe the TDSA can remain an FPRP obligation ( like any other 
development agreement signed by a project entity that is subsequently 
transferred into Turbo Park). Since the TDSA now only involves soft cost 
expenditures, FPRP can sign it as soon as it is negotiated and agreed by 
Stone & Webster and before it goes into Phase I of Turbo Park.

The B& V Agreement, which was modeled on Black & Veatch's agreement with 
FPUA, also can be signed prior to going into Phase I as soon as it is 
negotiated with Black & Veatch. Like the TDSA, there are commercial terms 
that need to be added. It was modeled on the FPUA Black & Veatch Agreement 
because that should speed negotiation with B & V on its terms, and we may 
want to assign the B & V Agreement to FPUA ( and they too would be 
comfortable with its terms). My understanding is that FPUA is supervising the 
transmission work and will be driving the design and engineering of the 
transmission facilities, so it may make sense for FPRP to assign the B & V 
Agreement to FPUA and simply retain the obligation to pay B & V ( up to a 
cap).

I also have attached a revised version of the spreadsheet Mathew prepared 
listing FPRP contracts already entered into by FPRP ( the so-called secondary 
development agreements)  and those proposed to be entered into before we go 
into Phase I of Turbo Park. Herman and Lisa, let me know which of  the 
secondary agreements you have not previously reviewed ( those marked NO re 
your review ) that you need to review, and I will endeavor to furnish them to 
you.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Pompano refuses $10,000 `gift' from Texas firm that wants power-plant OK 

By LISA J. HURIASH Sun-Sentinel?????? 
Web-posted: 11:43 p.m. Dec. 7, 2000

???POMPANO BEACH -- The city has returned a $10,000 check to a powerful 
Texas-based company that wants to build a controversial power plant here.
???Enron North America, one of the world's largest energy conglomerates, has 
proposed a 510-megawatt plant for a 30-acre site south of Sample Road and 
east of Florida's Turnpike. 
???Company officials hand-delivered the check last Friday, requesting that 
the money be used for cultural arts programs. The city manager returned it on 
Tuesday. 
???""While your donation is believed to be a genuine and unrelated corporate 
support of the community, the timing of your donation has the potential of 
creating a false impression and perception of its intent and purpose,"" City 
Manager C. William Hargett Jr. wrote in a letter to Steve Krimsky, director 
of Enron. 
???""Therefore, I am returning your check."" 
???The company is planning to pitch its development project to the city's 
Planning and Zoning Board later this month. Eventually the issue will come 
before the City Commission.
???The company hopes to start construction in April and begin operating the 
plant on May 1, 2002. It would be the fifth power plant in Broward County, 
and the third largest.
???City officials applauded returning the check to Enron.
???""I think their intentions were very questionable,"" said Commissioner Kay 
McGinn. ""The city did the honorable thing in returning the check.""
???""We have been talking about cultural arts. But did they do it for 
something in return?"" asked Mayor Bill Griffin. ""The best thing we did was to 
return the check.""
???There wasn't anything improper about the gift, said Eric Thode, spokesman 
for Enron.
???""The city has a right to its opinion. I would say Enron nationwide has 
been recognized for its philanthropic activities. We want to be a good 
corporate citizen and support the community. These are not political 
contributions. Supporting cultural activities, children's activities, these 
are things we have typically supported in various areas where we do 
business,"" he said.
???When the company built a plant in Illinois, for example, it also built a 
playground in that city, Thode said.
???Two cities near the Pompano site, Margate and Coconut Creek, have 
expressed concern about the plant and air-quality regulators, worry it would 
rely too heavily on diesel fuel. Diesel fuel releases nitrogen oxide, a 
leading cause of smog, which can worsen asthma, bronchitis and other 
breathing problems. 
???The plant would burn diesel fuel up to 1,500 hours a year, according to 
its permit application to the state Department of Environmental Protection.
???Hargett said in his letter that he hopes when the plant controversy is 
over, and the timing is better, Enron will come through financially.
???""Hopefully, Enron will continue its support of the community and consider 
a future donation following completion of the various matters pending before 
the city,"" he wrote in his letter to Krimsky.
???Thode noted that the check was not written to the city.
???""We would not cut a check directly to a city government,"" he said. ""Our 
budget has standards.""
???The check was made payable to the non-profit Pompano Beach Cultural Arts 
Foundation, which raises money for city-sponsored cultural programs. The five 
city commissioners, who will vote on the power plant, act as the foundation's 
directors.
???Enron officials met with Coconut Creek City Manager John Kelly and his 
staff Thursday to discuss their concerns about the plant's impact. Because of 
the area's wind conditions, the gases from the plant's 80-foot stacks would 
blow in the general direction of Margate, Coconut Creek, Coral Springs and 
Parkland.
???Kelly said it was a ""good exchange of information"" and he expects future 
meetings.
???""They're trying to be the good neighbor and get into the community,"" Kelly 
said, referring to the returned check. ""It probably came off the wrong way.""
???He added that he was relieved Pompano Beach returned the money.
???""It gives us all a comfort level we're going to deal with it objectively,"" 
he said. ""Checks don't make the air better.""

here is what people need to know - it will save A LOT of calling around...
to get the blood typed (if you don't already have a card or letter from dr.
stating blood type)- you go to the MD Anderson Hospital, Donor Room in the
purple zone, 1st floor.  The phone number is 713-792-2626.  There is an $11
charge to type the blood.  I was told that I would be given a card with my
blood type.

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Thank you very much for meeting with me again today over lunch. I appreciated 
the opportunity to catch up with you.

Please find attached my current resume (both a short and a long version). I 
have worked as a trader, portfolio risk manager, and a stock analyst. I have 
traded derivatives, bonds, and stocks,  and managed insurance and pension 
investment portfolios to maximize risk-adjusted returns.  Let me highlight 
some of my work experiences.

Trading and Risk Management
    a.. Structured, negotiated, and traded OTC interests rate swaps, 
cross-currency swaps, swaptions, and exchange-traded equity index futures and 
options. Made PowerPoint presentations to GARP and the UOH on credit 
derivatives.
    b.. Developed investment hedging program utilizing exchanged-traded bond 
futures and interest rate swaps.
    c.. Traded and managed pension and insurance fixed income portfolios to 
maximize total return and funding ratios. Bonds traded: Treasuries, Agencies, 
MBS/CMOs, ABS, Corporate, Yankees, and Foreign.
    d.. Traded and managed stock mutual portfolios for total return.
    e.. Created a computer program to quantify the attribution of total 
return for fixed income portfolios relative to market returns.
    f.. Programmed investment compliance rules to monitor the management of 
domestic and global stock, bond and money market mutual funds.
    g.. Supervised market risks, credit risks, legal risks, and operations 
risks of derivatives, bonds, money market securities, and equities.
Policy , Reporting and Projects
    a.. Developed investment policy guidelines to manage fixed income 
portfolios.
    b.. Rewrote derivatives policy manual.
    c.. Prepared a 20-page PowerPoint slide presentation on India for the 
senior management.
    d.. Prepared and presented investment reports to CIOs, Investment 
Committees, and Boards of Trustees
I shall, therefore, appreciate your help in connecting me with the right 
individual within Enron for a job interview to work as a financial 
trader/risk manager. I can provide excellent references upon request.

Thank you for the lunch.

Subject: Investment Banking Fee to Bear, Stearns & Co.

In connection with our sale of shares/warrants in FirstWorld Communications 
to TPG Partners III, L.P. earlier this year, ENA engaged Bear, Stearns & Co. 
to assist ENA and Enron Communications as financial advisor and agent.  Kevin 
Garland sent me earlier this week (via Steve Horn) a copy of the 
corresponding engagement letter dated 01-Dec-99 and signed by Garland and 
Horn (and by Richard Lewis of Bear, Stearns).  It stipulates that Bear, 
Stearns shall receive as fee 2% of the aggregate consideration received by 
ENA, or $2,582,351 (plus $25,000 in out of pocket expenses).

Horn and Garland (and our accounting department) have confirmed to me that we 
have not previously paid any fee to Bear, Stearns for this transaction.  
Given the fact that the economics of the deal accrued to the account of ENA, 
it is probably only fair that we pay the fee.  I have instructed Stacy Hardy 
in accounting to wire the money prior to year end.

Sorry to hit you with this so late in the year, but I only found out about it 
two days ago.  Call me if you have questions.

PG&E Bankruptcy Will Not Affect Calpine's Commitment to California Power 
Market
/FROM PR NEWSWIRE SAN FRANCISCO  415-543-7800/

TO BUSINESS AND ENERGY EDITORS:

PG&E Bankruptcy Will Not Affect Calpine's Commitment to California

Power Market

SAN JOSE, Calif., April 9 /PRNewswire/ -- In response to Pacific Gas and
Electric Company's (PG&E) April 6th Chapter 11 filing, Calpine Corporation
(NYSE: CPN), the San Jose, Calif.-based independent power company, stated it
is confident that PG&E, through a successful reorganization, will be able to
pay Calpine's Qualifying Facility (QF) subsidiaries for all past due power
sales, in addition to electricity deliveries made on a going-forward basis.

CALPINE'S QF SUBSIDIARIES SELL POWER TO PG&E UNDER THE TERMS OF LONG-TERM
QF CONTRACTS AT ELEVEN FACILITIES, REPRESENTING NEARLY 600 MEGAWATTS OF
ELECTRICITY FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWER CUSTOMERS.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2001,
CALPINE HAS RECORDED APPROXIMATELY $267 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WITH
PG&E, PLUS A $68 MILLION NOTE RECEIVABLE NOT YET DUE AND PAYABLE.  THE
COMPANY'S REMAINING CALIFORNIA OPERATIONS, TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 700 
MEGAWATTS OF CAPACITY, PROVIDE ELECTRICITY TO MUNICIPALITIES AND OTHER 
CREDITWORTHY THIRD PARTIES.

CALPINE'S QF FACILITIES ARE PART OF A 9,000-MEGAWATT QF SUPPLY THAT
PROVIDE CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS WITH A LONG-TERM SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY AT PRICES
SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW CURRENT WHOLESALE PRICES.  THIS CRITICAL POWER SUPPLY
REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 33 PERCENT OF THE STATE'S POWER DEMAND.  WITHOUT
THESE CONTRACTS IN PLACE FOR THIS SUMMER, CALIFORNIA FACES THE PROSPECT OF
MORE BLACKOUTS AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INCREASED COSTS.

FOR THESE QF CONTRACTS TO CONTINUE, PG&E MUST ASSUME THE CONTRACTS IN THE
BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.  IN ORDER TO ASSUME THESE CONTRACTS, PG&E WILL BE
REQUIRED TO CURE ALL OUTSTANDING DEFAULTS, INCLUDING PAYING ALL PAST DUE
AMOUNTS.  IF PG&E FAILS TO ASSUME THE CONTRACTS, CALPINE'S QF SUBSIDIARIES
WILL BE ABLE TO SELL POWER ON THE OPEN MARKET AND SEEK DAMAGES FROM PG&E FOR
BREACH OF CONTRACT THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY CLAIMS RESOLUTION PROCESS.

RE:     Southern Advice

ADVICE TO NORTHERNERS MOVING SOUTH:

The following is a pre-approved posting whose purpose is to offer insight
and advice to Northerners moving South.

1.  Save all manner of bacon grease. You will be instructed on how to use
it
shortly.
2.  Just because you can drive on snow and ice does not mean Southerners
can. Stay home the two days of the year it snows.
3.  If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic.  Four men in the cab
of a four-wheel pick-up with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be
along shortly. Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way. This is
what they live for.
4.  You can ask Southerners for directions, but unless you already know the
positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better off trying to find
it yourself.
5.  Remember: ""Y'all is singular.""  ""All y'all is plural."" All y'all's is
plural possessive.""
6. Get used to hearing, ""You ain't from around here, are you?""
7.  Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't
understand you, either.
8.  The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted Northerner's
vocabulary is the adjective ""big ol,"" as in ""big ol truck,"" or ""big ol
boy.""
9.  As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55-mph zone, directly
in the middle of the road, remember: ALL Southern folks learned to drive on
a John Deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for that
vehicle.
10. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, ""Hey, y'all, watch this!"" Stay out of
his way. These are likely the last words he will ever say, or worse still,
that you will ever hear.
11. Most Southerners do not use turn signals; they ignore those who do. In
fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a Southern license plate,
you may rest assured that it was already turned on when the car was
purchased.
12. If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking, let alone
eating.
13. The wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait until
December.
14. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the most
minuscule accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local
grocery store. It does not matter if you need anything from the store.
It is just something you're supposed to do.
15. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. When you purchase
one,it
is positioned directly in front of the house. This is logical, bearing in
mind that the dish cost considerably more than the house, and should,
therefore, be prominently displayed.
16.  Be advised that in the South, ""He needed killin'"" is a valid defense.

It apprears that only an agreement  with ENA was set up previously.  ECT

Despite the fact the bill, by itself, does not guarantee payment for overdue 
receivables, the QFs on today's call decided to go forward and push for SBX 
47 irrespective of the progress on SBX 33.  A press conference is planned for 
Friday by IEP.  Bowen, who heads up the first committee that this bill will 
go through will have hearings on this bill on Tuesday at the earliest.

Jan S-J asked every QF to fax to IEP a description of all QF generation and 
the zip code of each project so that they can begin lobbying specific 
legislators.  A significant PR push is planned.

SBX 47 is opposed by SCE.  PG&E's position appears more ambivalent.  One 
angle would be to try to get PG&E to support Enron's swap/SC language and 
make inclusion of such language a condition of PG&E's support.

Thanks very much for your memo Paul it is very helpful.  I attach below for=
=20
completeness the To Do list put together by Elena in order to put Credit on=
=20
EnronOnline. =20
There are two remaining issues which require further thought:-

1.  How do we want to display Credit on a long term basis on EnronOnline. =
=20
For the short term, we can put credit out there but the number of updates=
=20
will be restricted.  Using Jay's best guess on a slow network connection th=
e=20
initialization process will take upto 4 minutes and on a normal connection=
=20
250 updates every 30 seconds would prevent people from trading.   So we do=
=20
have some scaling issues? Our model doesn't really function for simultaneou=
se=20
changing of hundreds of products so really we need to actually get a much=
=20
better specific on how many updates you envisage.   Do you really envisage=
=20
that many updates?  Also we haven't yet experienced fast updates which we=
=20
will do when FX joins the system.

2.  We have approximately 4000 guest id and passwords?  Can these see credi=

Subject: Credit Trading OnLine - Results of Legal Due Diligence and Risk Me=
mo

NOTE - GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF 24 JANUARY 2000 FOR THIS PRODUCT,=
=20
THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGA=
L=20
DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO

As you know, we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries=
=20
where it was intended the credit product  would initially be traded via=20
EnronOnLine - namely, the UK, the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway,=20
Sweden and Switzerland.  Under the terms of the credit product, on the=20
occurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the=20
Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or=
=20
its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed=
=20
currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differ=
s=20
in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in=
=20
the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms =
of=20
our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely=
=20
change the analysis below.)

Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more=20
significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page ""Executive Summar=
y=20
of Legal Advice"" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significa=
nt=20
legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction=
=20
with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus =
on=20
issues we raised which are ""all clear"" from a legal perspective, so as to=
=20
keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news=
=20
too!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out belo=
w=20
what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, =
on=20
the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely=
=20
to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a=
=20
risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk=
=20
is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take.

A.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000

 Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US

B.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to b=
e=20
delayed

 Canada, Germany (reasons set out below)

C.  General Issues (applicable in all countries)

The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and=20
related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks=
=20
of a general nature:

(i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our=20
counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade t=
he=20
product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional=20
documents before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies t=
o=20
almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in=
=20
all countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general=
=20
law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under=
=20
their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their=
=20
constitutional documents if they wish to trade). =20

The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading=20
relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particular=
ly=20
onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally.

(ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure=
=20
that we are not misusing confidential information about our business=20
counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur=
=20
both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not includ=
e=20
formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o=
r=20
the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US=
=20
counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include=
=20
(a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the=
=20
procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure tha=
t=20
confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which=
=20
we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali=
ty=20
agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron=
=20
has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, o=
r=20
otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will=
=20
need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Withou=
t=20
such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha=
t=20
entity for breach of confidence.

D.  Country Specific Issues

(i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute=
=20
insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the=
=20
product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve=
=20
this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in=20
Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear=
=20
which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter.

(ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in=
=20
Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially.

(iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be=

The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by 
Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks  
plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure. A hard copy 
is being faxed. The expert firm alleges they were ""retained...to explain, 
research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy 
providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] 
...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services."" After 
alleging that the Hendricks attorneys ""refused to pay Plaintiffs' first 
billing""  it is alleged that""defendants' refusal may have resulted from the 
conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis."" We should consider if there is 
there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly 
Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert 
in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently 
concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect 
that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some 
use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward. This is not 
urgent timewise but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

The following documents are attached:

1)  Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement between enovate and PetroCanada.  I 
have made the following changes to Mary's document:
 a) effective date of November 1st, 2000 to coincide with the start of the 
transaction,
 b) notification for nominations/confirmations, and 
 c) signature line from enovate to enovate by Enron MW.

Jeff - Can you please print out two copies of this document, initial and have 
your assistant deliver them to Janet for execution.  Janet will be leaving 
for the management conference on Wednesday around noon so the earlier in the 
morning the better.  I will then have Janet's assistant get them back to me 
for delivery to PetroCanada.



2)  Audit Waiver

Kay - Can you please print out two copies, initial and I suppose your 
assistant can coordinate with Jeff's to make the delivery to Janet.  I will 
take care of getting Bill's signature.



Thank you both for your assistance.  Any questions or comments, let me know.

		 Subject: Senate Action on DOD Conference Report

Tonight by a vote of 91/2 (although Senator Wellstone was asking to switch 
his vote; so the final vote may end up being 90/3) the Senate passed the 
Conference Report on the DOD Reauthorization, H.R. 4205.  With the 
overwhelming majority votes in both the House and Senate this week, the bill 
will now be enrolled and sent to the President for signature.

Although the statutory language and report language is a clear victory for 
EFS; we did not in the end have the draft colloquy entered into the record 
regarding the enforcement interpretation.  Seems EEI's lawyers had submitted 
a colloquy of their own.  Thus, our colloquy successfully served the purpose 
of blocking theirs which we should list as a ""victory"" given that their 
colloquy would have been damaging to us.  So in the end, Enron achieved all 
its legislative goals while EEI was unsuccessful in even gaining a statement 
for the record.

Off the record, we did gain acceptance for the issue raised in our colloquy 
by DOD and they stand ready to defend their enforcement authority; possibly 
at the upcoming NARUC meeting.

Bill signature; and thus, Public Law enactment, could occur as early as next 
week.  We will keep you advised as to when this occurs.  Again, 
congratulations to the team for a successful legislative effort against some 
stiff odds.",Senate Action on DOD Conference Report

I see that ENA is a contemplated counterparty for Japanese weather 
derivatives.  There are both legal and tax issues that require 
consideration.  

I am unsure if Susan Musch has had the opportunity to review the tax issues, 
therefore I have copied her on this note.

With regard to Japanese legal issues, there are certain matters that must be 
dealt with in the GTCs, if entering into transactions between ENA and 
Japanese counterparties are being considered, including issues of an 
underlying legitimate business purpose to avoid gambling restrictions etc.

Please inform me with whom I should be in contact to ensure that these issues 
are appropriately handled.

I just returned from the Bond Market Association meeting this afternoon on
the pending bankruptcy legislation.  Chris Long (Enron) was there with
Ellen Levinson of our Washington office.
The ""big"" issue discussed was whether to push hard for amendments on
cross-affiliate netting.  The consensus was that while everyone in the room
(and all of Wall Street was there,as well as ISDA and commodities groups)
wants the amendments, they are considered controversial by the President's
Working Group and could derail progress on the version of bankruptcy reform
currently before Congress which everyone also agrees is very good
legislation for financial markets participants.  On the basis that getting
the current bill enacted quickly is of paramount importance, the
Association determined to ""back pocket"" the cross-affiliate netting issue,
meaning that if the current legislation moves quickly, the Association will
not raise the issue but if the legislation gets bogged down in committee
and other nontechnical changes are being proposed, the Association will use
that opportunity to add cross-affiliate netting provisions.

Feel free to call if you have any questions.

I've requested the issuance of a draft master (gas) for Clarksdale.  Yazoo 
has theirs in hand, but I haven't heard any of any comments.

The power side is a bit more complicated.  Yazoo City and Clarksdale have not 
cut a deal between them to determine how to buy power - whether it should be 
bought  by MDEA (easier in some accounting respects, but credit is more of an 
issue) or by the individual Cities.  

Maybe this should be on the list for our 300 meeting.

With respect to the 15 million of increased VAR that the Board allocated to 
Rick Buy and Jeff Skilling I propose the following:

1.  5 Million be allocated to EES and therefore remove EES's positions from 
the Wholesale gas and power groups (This has already been done).

2.  Move the control and decision making of 5 Million of VAR each to the 
trading heads of North America (Lavorato) and Europe (Sherriff).

3.  With respect to North America I intend to create a group called the 
""Cross Commodity Trading Group"" which will warehouse the 5 Million of VAR and 
use it as it sees fit (I will run this group and currently be the only 
employee).  This will start out as an administrative structure to use if we 
need to throw more VAR at certain positions (I see the individual trading 
groups staying within their VAR limits).  However, I do see the need for a 
true cross commodity group that would search for low risk / high probability 
trades accross the commodities that we trade.  This structure may help to 
start us down this path.

Please let me know what you think.

Rick --

The information below is very helpful for Government Affairs across the 
country.  I have a few other questions to support our advocacy:  

1. How much of our new power plant development is not subject to Building & 
Construction Trade Labor Agreements? 

2. Does Enron have any specific policies on whether or not we should use 
Union labor on our construction?  We recently established human rights and 
environmental policies, I am wondering if this applied to Unions?

3. Do you know if the pipelines are also using Union labor on their 
expansions?  Or maybe, who could tell me?

Thanks.

Sandy, I was again disapointed to hear that Union leaders are accusing Enron 
as being unfriendly to Labor.  In the last 20 months we have pursued 
construction on over 3000 MW of new generation capacity.  
Enron Development Activity subject to Building & Construction Trade Labor 
Agreements
California 
 500 mw - PDEF - FeB. 99
 750 mw - PEF - Feb. 2000
Indiana
 550 mw- Westfork Development -  Oct. 99
Illinois
 680 mw - Lincoln Energy Facility - Nov 99 
Tennessee
 540 mw -  Gleason Power I - Oct 99
Oregon 
 240 mw - Coyote II (planned January 2001)
 Ethynol Plant - Columbia County - Baugh Const. June 2000

Hopefully this will prove to be valuable information:  In addition to the 
direct agreements, Enron is pursuing third party projects in Chicago and New 
York City that will be subject to labor agreements.

If the parties are interested, feel free to have them contact me directly

Mark

Not sure of your exact email address but hopefully one of these is correct.
Can you please confirm that you receive this?

Below is the agreement our attorneys have drafted for the transfer of the
www.weather-desk.com domain name.  Note that they have recommended that a
few of the more specific details regarding the corresponding Enron usage of
the RMS weather model be addressed in a simple but separate license
agreement.   As discussed, in addition to general confidentialiy
provisions, those terms will include (1) the access will not cover any
international weather data that may be added to the system during the term
of use through December 31, as our costs associated with such data are
uncertain and (2) the use of the model will be for Enron internal purposes
only with no data or analysis results to be shared with third parties.

I would appreciate if you can forward this to your legal dept. to review so
that we can hopefully get this resolved quickly.

Thanks/regards

Paul

Mike: You can certainly count on my support.  My son Brandon Johnson was 
diagnosis with JD when he was 11 years old.  Needless to say my family was 
traumatised by the event, however my son handled it like a trooper.  He is 
now 16 years old and has very good days with his blood sugar, but then he has 
his bad ones as well.  I have walked since he was first diagnosed with JD and 
will continue to provide my support.

Thx

Wanda

Subject: Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Fundraising

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is ""Knock Out Diabetes"" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

Dave,

I am sorry to bother you with this, but I need the benefit of your global 
information base.  Please take a look at the attached email that I sent 
yesterday (the critical issue is in bold faced type).  It is really important 
that we provide a prompt response so that Cinergy can complete their FERC 
filings in a timely manner.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

I believe the correct answer is only New Albany since we do not control the 
MW's for Doyle.  New Albany is a nominal 380MW facility.

Sam Behrends of LLGM needs to have an answer to the following question no 
later than the end of business today.  Please provide any information that 
you might have.

""Following the sale of the 2000 peakers to Allegheny and the two 99 peakers 
to Cinergy, how much generation will Enron still own within two wheels of 
TVA?""

I think that the answer is New Albany and Doyle (except that we only own 50% 
of Doyle and Doyle does not have any merchant capacity to sell (i.e. the 
facility is fully dedicated to Oglethorpe)).  I am not certain, however, that 
I have thought of everything and don't know the capacities for these two 
facilities.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Stuart

		 Subject: Final Status Report of EBS East Asia Regulatory Matters

 As many of you know, I am going to be leaving Enron to pursue new 
opportunities.  
  I am leaving with regret,  as I have enjoyed working with all of you, and I 
believe EBS
  is poised for great success in Asia.   To assist in a smooth transition,  I 
have prepared 
  this report on  the status of all EBS East Asia regulatory affairs actions 
I am working on, 
  and my thoughts about next steps.    A list of key contacts is also 
provided.    Mark 
  Schroeder will reassign pending actions.   

   Again, many, many thanks for your support and encouragement and for what I 
have 
   learned about broadband and EBS from each of you. 

1.   Singapore

 (a)  SBO License Application:   

        The application was completed in draft in December.   Dan Arzola of 
EBS Asia 
        has a copy in Houston.   We cannot proceed further on the application 
until we 
        decide what  legal entity to use.   We have a legal entity (Enron 
Broadband 
        Services Pte Ltd) set up that encompasses all EBS activities 
including bandwidth t
        trading.   

        The legal entity that we use in the application will have to pay a 1% 
annual gross
        turnover fee unless we get it waived by the regulator on the grounds 
that the 
        turnover fee was never intended to capture bandwidth trading 
revenue.   This 
        is a possible option in my opinion as the regulator (IDA) does not 
want to be working at cross
        purposes with other parts of the government that wish to provide EBS 
with incentives.  
        See below.
     
    (b)  Legal Due Diligence:
   
        However, before pursuing a waiver from IDA,  we were planning to 
complete legal due 
        diligence to examine any options for avoiding the fee without a 
waiver.   
        Donald is of the view (see his Jan 9 e-mail ) that bandwidth trading 
has to be
        licensed by the regulator.  ( In Europe, bandwidth trading usually 
does not 
        require telecom licensing.)   If Donald is correct as he probably is, 
there may be 
        less need of further legal research  on that point unless perhaps to 
confirm absolutely 
        that there is no way to shield EBS bandwidth trading from the 
turnover fee apart from
        a waiver or reduction of the fee.    For example it is possible  that 
Jan Haizmann 
        or others may figure out a way to have actual trades escape the fee 
(done offshore 
        for example).   Jan I believe has some ideas on this that he adanced 
in the context
        of Korea.  

        I believe it would still be prudent  to proceed as we had planned to 
engage
        a law firm here in Singapore (as we have in Hong Kong and Japan) for 
the purpose 
        of guiding us through these sorts of questions (or at least 
confirming our reading)
        and answering the many other questions posed in a matrix developed by 
a working 
        group headed by Wayne Gardner.   We will likely be needing the firm 
anyway at 
        some point.  
        
        I have prepared a list of seven law firms engaged in telecoms 
practice in Singapore.
        EBS General Counsel is planning to examine its Asia strategy and whom 
to send and
        when to engage a firm to complete Wayne's questionnaire and for other 
purposes.

         My advice is, after the due diligence is completed or we have at 
least confirmed
         that bandwidth trading is required to be in the licensed entity,  
probably to go to the IDA and 
         discuss the implications of the fee for us.   The contacts I would 
suggest discussing this
         with are Andy Haire and Fiona Yeo (see contact list).]      IDA does 
not wish to prevent 
         EBS's coming to Singapore, and the fee was of course set up without 
bandwidth trading
         specifically in mind as a revenue source.   Bandwidth trading was 
referenced in the
         Code only later as a result of Enron's comment letters.

  (c)  Arthur D Little consultant proposal to support EBS Pioneer Status 
Application

         This 75k proposal is now with us in final form, after undergoing 
changes by me
         and two by our Houston tax lawyers.   I was to have gone to ADL 
Singapore next
         for a meeting to question them on how much of this they are able to 
         do independently without reliance on us.   This was a suggestion 
made by
         Jim Ginty of EBS tax to make sure they would not be reprocessing our 
info,    
         I also intended to get them to pinpoint which of the products would 
be quantified,
         rather than a ""where appropriate.""     Assuming we proceed with this 
proposal, 
         someone else will need to do this conversation with ADL Singapore.   

         I have forwarded the final proposal to Wayne Garder and Mark and 
most other
         interested parties earlier this week.

        NB:   Someone needs to be appointed to contact Simon MacCormac at ADL 
and explain
        at least our timing and process for getting back to him, as a 
courtesy.   I have not 
        replied to his final submission as of now.   See contact info at end 
of e-mail.

         For background,  the reason I believe EBS needs this work and sought 
a consultant
         proposal is that Pioneer Status is typically awarded  to companies 
that make major
         dollar, infrastructure, and job-creation expenditures in 
Singapore.   Our business
         model does just the opposite.   So, to be awarded Pioneer Status, 
which the EDB is
         very willing to consider us for after many months of persuasion,  I 
believe we need to  
         help EDB demonstrate what the quantitative spin-off benefits are for 
Singapore from our
         developing bandwidth trading here (e.g. increased efficiencies of 
capacity utilization,
         effect of lower bandwidth prices on attracting investment).   This 
is a job for a  development 
         economist teamed with someone who knows about bandwidth trading.   
To my mind,
         if ADL cannot produce the bandwidth trading specialist we want, it 
might be worth it 
         to have one of our experts assigned to liaise with  them, and adjust 
the contract
         accordingly to reflect what part we are providing.         

         One thing the ADL scope of work does not provide for is the actual 
completion of
         the Pioneer Status Application - only the supporting economic 
analysis.  That is because it is
         proper for us to be the ones outlining our business plan for 
Singapore, rather than
         running that information through ADL and charging its overhead.  The 
idea is to get
         ADL to perform the quantitative economic development analysis we 
cannot do in-house.  

    (d)   Direct contact with EDB on EBS's plans

         EDB (Chelsia Lim ) has this week asked EBS to update her on its 
business
         plans for Singapore.    I have made sure Craig Clark will take the 
responsibility
         for seeing this is handled.   While a courtesy call is fine, I would 
advise 
         not to brief her formally until EBS has really decided what our 
plans are,
         with staffing, etc.   They have been asking for our plans for a 
while, and
         are waiting for some specifics when we have them.


2.    Hong Kong

        We have  2 licenses:   IVANS (value added services) and ETS (external
        telecoms services (includes bandwidth trading).

        There are several documents in draft and clearance which need to be 
filed
        under these licenses before we are able to operate in Hong Kong.  
        The principal ones are (a)  the system configuration plan,   (b) the 
tariff for
        sale and trading of circuits under the ETS license (c) the tariff for 
Mediacast 
        services under the IVANS license, and (later) (d) a tariff for 
VOD/EOD to
        be filed under the IVANS license.

        (a)  status of system configuration plan:

        The plan is done in draft and is being held pending a decision to be
         communicated by Roger Estrada within the next week or two as to 
whether 
         the Lucent 10G equipment described in the plan will be changed to 
other 
         equipment.    The HK lawyers  (Michelle Chan of Clifford Chance)  
have said 
         that if we plan to provide other equipment at the outset, we ought 
to just
         wait and send in the correct description rather than revise.   If we 
do stick with
         the Lucent equipment , we will also need to revise our orginal 
license 
         application as well (says Michelle Chan)  to include description of 
related
         Cisco equipment that was not mentioned in our orginal license 
application.

         When the system configuration plan is done in final, we also need to 
         change the listed destination in the diagram from ""San Jose""  to 
""West Coast
         USA,  Japan, Singapore, and Australia"".

         There are two copies of the present draft submission typed on the 
OFTA forms. 
          I have given one to Craig Clark of EBS to carry back to Houston.  
The other
         copy is with Annie Ng in our Singapore office.

         When we know what equipment we are going to be using, Tom Wei needs 
to
         revise the diagram and also make the changes in destination referred 
to above.
         Other small edits need to be made in Appendix A (see Dec 28 e-mail 
referenced
         below).   My successor should review the whole package once more 
with Michelle
         Chan in final.    Then the final package needs to be cleared by 
Anthony Duenner
         and our EBS lawyers before going to Ken Rice or another qualified 
Director of
         our Hong Kong company for signature.   After that it goes back to 
Michelle Chan
         for filing with OFTA.

         NB:   See Michelle Chan's e-mail of Dec 28, being repeated 
separately, for 
                  further information.  

       (b)   Tariffs for BWTrading under ETS License 

        In December in Houston I worked with Bill White and his staff on a 
tariff plan for
        bandwidth trading in HK.   Based on a meeting I had with the 
regulator in Hong 
        Kong,   we agreed to file pro forma ceiling prices rather than an 
entirely new
        and variable system which the regulator insisted we not do.   
Ceiling  prices 
        were developed and submitted to Michelle Chan for review.   

        Along with the prices we are required to submit our Terms and 
Conditions.   For 
        that I used EBS General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) for trading 
obtained from 
        Robbi Rossi and Michelle Heard.  Mike Grimes  has a set as well.   

        Present status:  Right now a dialogue is under way between Michelle 
Chan and  
        Robbi Rossi as to whether it is sufficient to file the GTC's alone or 
whether 
        certain exhibits, service level agreements, and confirmations 
referred to in
        the GTC's must also be filed.   There are other questions being 
discussed in
        that channel  such as how to handle variations in the terms based on
        commercial dynamics.     All these e-mails will be  forwarded.   Once 
these
        issues related to the GTCs are resolved, the tariff for bandwidth 
trading should
        be filed, going through Michelle Chan.

        NB:  See Michelle Chan e-mail of 1/09/01 which being forwarded 
separately.


     (c)  Tariff for Media Cast under IVANS license:

       I worked with Leroy Ho and Ken Wang in December and we submitted the 
main
       part of the Media Cast tariff to Michelle Chan.   However, we still 
need to get the
       Terms and Conditions for Media Cast from Robbi Rossi or Michelle Heard 
and
       attach them to the tariff diagrams and submit them to Michelle Chan. 
       
       NB:   See my e-mail to Michelle Chan of Dec 21 which being repeated.
       Someone needs to work with EBS legal to get the T and C's for Media 
Cast to Michelle
       or to set up direct channel between EBS legal and Michelle Chan as in
       the case of the exchanges on the T and C's for Bandwidth trading 
referred
       to above.

      (d)   Overall change of responsibility for EBS Regulatory HK 

        Michael,  or whomever will be taking over these responsibilities, 
should 
        get from Michelle Chan of Clifford Chance Hong Kong a fresh copy of 
        Alison Lindsay's letter to Xi Xi of October 2000 stating that we 
received 
        our licenses and setting forth in detail all of the requirements.   
This is the 
        master document (""bible"") on compliance under our licenses and will 
catch any
        detail not included above.   For example:

            - my successor should also file a new form with OFTA,  the Hong 
Kong 
              regulator (form is included in the attachments to the letter)  
naming 
              himself the point of contact, replacing me.    Michelle Chan 
can forward
              the letter to the regulator.

           -  we will need to be selecting an independent auditor to certify 
certain routine
              reports we may need to file in future.   I have not started on 
that.

       Robbi Rossi needs to call Kim and Chang (law firm we use in Korea)
       to authorize them to research and provide advice to us on how to 
handle 
       the apparent regulatory impediment to Bandwidth Trading in Korea that
       we identified during my November trip.

       Once Kim and Chang starts work on this, someone from regulatory should
       be made available to help guide Kim and Chang on our regulatory 
       questions, in coordination with Robbi Rossi.

       The key e-mails are (a) one from me outlining the overall problem and
        some suggestions for dealing with it ;  (b) one from Jan Haizmann 
with 
        some additional and in some cases alternative suggestions on how
        to deal with it,  (c)  two from Jae Moo Lee in Korea with additional
        points of view.  These will be forwarded.  


  4.   Japan  

       Our regulatory consultant is Art Yanagawa.   Contact info below.  Mike 
Grimes 
       and I have been in meetings with him and  Mike is fully briefed to 
carry on the 
       on-the-ground  part of contacts with Art.   Art also responds to 
Donald and 
       Roger Estrada and relies on them for guidance and input.     

      At some point it should be thought through who should be the point 
person
      to manage  this contract and approve payments, or decide to leave things
      as they are with approvals done in Houston.    The present system works 
but
      it is not clear to me who is responsible for what.  

      Art has prepared the amendment to our Special Type 2  license to add
      service to other destinations.   The latest status was that he was 
holding
      the amendment over the holidays while clarifying some points raised by
      Mike Grimes.    Someone needs to be assigned responsibility for
      getting the amendment through.  

      General Concern:      

      A more general regulatory concern for us in Japan is that our 
consultant 
      advises us that we cannot use the term bandwidth trading  in 
      communications with the government because it is not something 
      contemplated in the Telecom Business Law,  so is prohibited if 
      stated as we would state it elsewhere.   

      We therefore are having to go through elaborate contortions to make 
      what we are planning to do actually look like we are doing something
      else.    I admit that I agree with the approach we are taking for now 
and 
      can offer nothing better for the immediate term.    

      However, I would say that long term we are running some risks.    If we 
      are going to make Japan  one of the centerpieces of our  Asia EBS 
      strategy,   I think we need to consider devoting more full time EBS 
      regulatory resources to Japan exclusively.    

       The allocation problem is that whatever regulatory resources we apply 
       have to focus on  immediate license amendment  and operational
       questions that drive out time to work effectively on long term
       issues such as how to go about amending the Telecommunications 
       Business Law  to allow bandwidth trading explicitly.    This would seem
       important to reduce long term risks to our business strategy. 

5.    ""Digital Divide""

       I had been giving intermittent support to helping Scott Yeager and 
Justin
       Cornett of EBS, and Will Reed of Technology for All, figure out how
       to expand the concept of Technology for All to Asia.    The strategy
       was to utilize some of Japan's $15 billion pledge of funds to support
       digital divide activities in Asia - to support the expansion into Asia 
of
       the EBS-supported TFA model.    This work will cease unless it can 
       be picked up by Laura Lannarone of corporate social responsbility 
       or Steve Burns of the DC office.

relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the 
transmission system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual

create an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and

Sara:

    As promised, this email discusses the securities laws issues involved
with equity derivatives, I
then make a few observations about the relationship between the securities
and commodities laws, and I
then makes some comments on the confirmations you sent me (both securities
laws comments and other
comments.

The principal securities laws issues relate to the fact that the equity
derivative itself is a security and to the
issue of whether and to what extent a counterparty=01,s activities in
establishing or unwinding a hedge are
attributable to the issuer.  When Enron enters into a derivative and the
counterparty goes out into the
market to make a purchase, is that purchase attributable to Enron?  When it
unwinds its hedge by making
a sale, is the counterparty=01,s sale attributable to Enron and therefore
required to be registered?  Here are
the principal issues:

1)  Rule 10b-5.  When Enron enters into a derivative, it must be sure it
does
not have undisclosed
material inside information regarding its affairs.  It is my understanding
that the traders are
supposed to check with Rex Rogers on the issue of whether Enron possesses
such information.
Although it could discharge its obligations under Rule 10b-5 by disclosing
the information to the
counterparty, that would probably be unacceptable since the counterparty
would then be in
possession of material inside information and could not engage in a market
transaction to hedge.
Thus, each time it enters into an equity derivative in its own stock, Enron
must be confident that
the public has available to it all material information regarding Enron.

2)  Rule 10b-18.  This rule permits issuers and persons acting in concert
with issuers to repurchase
the issuer=01,s  shares under a =01&safe harbor=018 that says in effect tha=
t if
purchases are made pursuant
to the rule they won=01,t be deemed to be manipulative by reason of the tim=
ing
and amounts of the
bids or purchases.  It is typical for an issuer to require its counterparty
to make purchases
pursuant to the rule.  Sometimes this is a contractual undertaking in the
confirmation, and in
some cases the issuer will simply obtain an oral commitment from the
counterparty to engage in
its hedges pursuant to the rule.  Obviously, it is better to have it in
writing.

3)  Registration of Sales.  If Enron decides to net share settle and issues
shares to the counterparty,
those are obviously restricted securities that cannot be sold by the
counterparty in the absence of a
registration statement.  But what about the resales by the issuer when it
unwinds its hedge that it
has put on by buying shares in the open market?  Are those sales
attributable
to the issuer so
therefore required to be registered?  I have seen lots of counterparties,
based on advice of their
law firms, take different positions on this:

a)  Some counterparties say that they want registration rights covering
resales of shares
purchased in the open market to hedge a derivative with the issuer.  If the
economics of
the derivative are determined based on the net proceeds from the sales, it=
=01,s

a more
difficult case because the issuer itself is realizing benefits and
detriments
from the sales.
b)  Some counterparties say they want registration rights covering resales
of
shares
purchased in the open market to hedge a derivative with the issuer only if
there is a
strong correlation at the onset of the contract between the terms of the
derivative and the
hedge.  It it=01,s a total return swap, for example, there will be a 1:1
correspondence (i.e.
the economics will tell you that the counterparty will buy 100% of the
shares
covered by
the swap immediately upon entering into the swap); but if it=01,s something
like
a collar
with divergent strike prices and involves dynamic hedging where it=01,s not
clear whether
and to what extent the counterparty will make purchases or sales in the ope=
n

market,
then it=01,s not as easy to attribute the counterparty=01,s actions to the =
issuer.

 In those cases
these counterparties look at the correlation and if it=01,s not that great =
they

don=01,t ask for
registration rights.
c)  Some counterparties say they don=01,t want registration rights for resa=
les
of stock
purchased in the open market to hedge their position.

Credit Suisse First Boston falls in category c) with respect to the May 200=
0

confirmation you sent
me. Even though there is a strong correlation between the deal and the hedg=
e

( i.e. even though
in that case they will no doubt immediately purchase 100% of the shares
covered by the
transaction) they are only asking for registration rights with respect to
the
shares that are
delivered by Enron on net share settlement.

4)  Commodities Laws.  Under the commodities laws there are some risks in
doing equity swaps in
that one has to rely on the swaps policy statement rather than the swaps
exemption, but those
risks are probably minimal enough that Enron is willing to take them.  (The
swaps exemption
does not cover equity swaps.)  With respect to equity options, they are
outside the CFTC=01,s
jurisdiction altogether.  Forward contracts present the most difficult
issues
in that there is a lot of
case law and CFTC lore about the distinction between forwards and futures,
and a key distinction
is that forwards are physical delivery contracts that bind the parties to
make and take delivery.
State bucket shop laws outlaw contracts that purport to be contracts for
sale
of a security that are
to be settled based on market price quotations.  So I would counsel Enron
not
to enter into any
forward contract that has a cash settlement alternative.  Although one can
argue that net share
settlement has the same defects, I don=01,t feel as strongly about that bec=
ause

you could get to where
you want to get by physically delivering the  shares and issuing  new share=
s

in payment; the
theory is that you actually delivered shares and just netted them out; that
is not quite as bad as
flying in the face of the case law and CFTC lore on net cash settlement.

The Bear Stearns Confirmation and Cancellation.  I really don=01,t have any
comments on this; I think the
cancellation was effective to cancel the parties obligations.  The
confirmation did not present any
registration issues.  I guess I would say that if you do something precisel=
y

like this you might get them to
agree to make any hedge purchases pursuant to Rule 10b-18, but that=01,s it=
.

The Credit Suisse First Boston Confirmation.  This is an extremely well
written document.  For the
reasons discussed above, I would counsel against entering into this kind of
transaction with the cash
settlement feature, in light of the risk that it could be characterized as
an
illegal, unenforceable futures
contract.  A few other comments: They say automatic early termination
applies, but I think that is a really
bad idea.  Enron had an agreement with a counterparty that took bankruptcy
and Enron did not find out
about it until a few days later, after the market had moved; since Enron di=
d

not know of the termination it
did not unwind its hedge, yet the ISDA said that the amounts payable on
termination would depend on the
termination date pricing.  So Enron took a loss.  You ought to always have
within your control the right to
terminate.  This is especially true of U.S. parties, but I would think the
same would apply to foreign
parties unless there is something peculiar about the law of the jurisdictio=
n

you are dealing with.

Both Confirmations  Both confirmations have language that says that if the
parties have not entered into
an ISDA Master then the counterparties=01, standard form controls.  I think=
 it
is not a good idea to agree to
such language because you are agreeing to something you know nothing about.

Additional Comment.  I think that whenever a counterparty requests
registration rights Rex should be
involved.  I think the CSFB confirmation=01,s provisions relating to
registration are fine, and of course they
can=01,t force us to register because the choice of net share settling is
purely
our choice.  Nevertheless, I
think that Rex needs to be involved so you and Rex need to get this point
across to the business people that
they shouldn=01,t just sign a confirmation and then send it to you and ask =
if
it
is ok.

But my bottom line is the only change I would make would be eliminating the
net cash settlement feature
in the CSFB confirmation.

all employees (except legal, admin, and human resources staff) to take the 
following steps immediately:

   1.  Save all e-mails, i.e., don't delete any e-mails.
   2.  Do not delete any information in databases.
   3.  Do not delete any word processing files or file fragments.
   4.  Do not delete any excel spreadsheets or calendars or scheduling 
programs. 
   5.  Any other electronic data not otherwise covered.

This request is being made in connection with the California AG's 
investigation into electricity prices.  We do not know how many other 
companies have received a similar order, but there is no reason for us to 
assume at this time that Enron has been singled out.  

Over the next few days we will be working with our technology group to figure 
out the most efficient way to manage this request.  This is a serious matter 
and we strongly urge every person affected by this request to cooperate fully 
with this order.  We appreciate your help with this and will keep you 
apprised of any changes in policy.

I like the changes to the Option Agreement, but do not really like the form 
of Memorandum of Option as it is not consistent with the form of Memorandum 
we have used in the past and in my opinion is deficient for recording 
purposes.  Please check out the one attached, which is the form we have 
typically used for our prior Options (subject to minor changes according to 
each state's recording requirements):

I have revised the option form consistent (except where noted) with comments 
sent by Herman and Lisa, and have attached a redline version.  Herman, I 
dealt with your comment regarding the defn of Optionee by tinkering a little 
with the 1st paragraph.  I also construed your comment regarding Enron's 
right to terminate the option to NOT preclude termination if our counterparty 
is in default.  Please confirm that this is acceptable.

Lisa, I did not change the notice info since the first entity will the the

be the following:

As we've discussed this week, the administration and the utilities continue 
to have a very difficult time reaching agreement on 1) how much of the 
undercollection the IOUs should absorb and how much consumers should absorb 
and 2) how big the rate increase should be to manage the IOUs cash 
flow/credit  problems (governor wants 10%, IOUs want at least 20%). 
It remains likely that the Commission will rule today on relaxing regulations 
to make it easier for the IOUs to enter into longer-term contracts w/out 
getting 2nd and 3rd guessed by the Commission.
It is likely that the Commission will signal strongly that it will not let 
the IOUs go bankrupt but will only go so far as to outline its plan for 
considering and implementing a ""rate stabilization"" plan in Q1 2001.

That said, the stakes are very high and things could change dramatically 
between now and 2 PM PST.  Just talked to two SVPs with PG&E and Edison and 
they said that they don't know what the Commission will do at 2.

It seems that there is a bug in the system. I made an error  mixing equity and
merit raises in one column. The system does not allow me to correct the 
mistake by
moving the entries from one column to another. I can enter the changes, but
after I save them the system  reverts to original  designations.

As a result, the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity

Fuel Cells Get Financial Boost from U.S. Government

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The Department of Energy will have more than $100 million for fuel cell=20
related programs in the new fiscal year, $10 million above the president's=
=20
request. The money is contained in the Interior Appropriation bill that=20
President Clinton signed last week. The House and Senate jointly agreed=20
upon $52.7 million for stationary fuel cells, $10 million more than=20
requested,=20
and approved the full request of $41.5 million for transportation fuel=20
cell research and $5.5 million for buildings.

ANALYSIS: This government funding, which is surprisingly higher than=20
expected,=20
should give a much-needed boost to the slow-moving development of fuel=20
cells. Although generally considered the favorite of low / zero emission=20
energy solutions, fuel cells are still about two to three years away from=
=20
being commercially viable in retail markets. (Phosphoric acid fuel cells,=
=20
developed by ONSI, a division of United Technologies, are presently availab=
le=20
in a limited capacity). The technology has been in existence ever since=20
batteries were discovered 160 years ago, but the high cost of producing=20
them has precluded suppliers from making fuel cells readily available to=20
the general public. Automotive giants like DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor=
=20
Co. have continued to explore the use of fuel cells in automobiles, and=20
Texaco, Inc. agreed in May to invest $67.2 million in Energy Conversion=20
Devices, a 40-year-old fuel cell and alternative energy development firm.=
=20
Yet, this financial support for the DOE's exploration of fuel cells signals=
=20
significant support from the federal government. In addition, warnings=20
about the high cost of oil and natural gas, and the reports of low supplies=
=20
of energy in states across the country, continue to scare energy end-users=
=20
and may be spurring a renewed interest in distributed generation options.

Here's how fuel cells work. They use an electrochemical reaction, as oppose=
d=20
to traditional combustion, to generate electricity. In other words, fuel=20
cells allow hydrogen-rich fuels to react chemically with air, without=20
burning,=20
producing as a byproduct DC electricity, water and heat. In addition, fuel=
=20
cells dramatically lower the level of pollutants that are emitted into=20
the environment. Test models of fuel cells presently convert methanol,=20
gasoline and natural gas to produce hydrogen fuel. It's easiest to think=20
of a fuel cell as a battery, but one that does not run down or need=20
recharging=20
(although it will need replacing about every five years). A fuel cell will=
=20
produce energy in the form of DC electricity and heat as long as fuel is=20
supplied. As an added advantage, fuel cells can be controlled remotely=20
by computer and run rather quietly. This is perhaps the primary incentive=
=20
for end-users that would be interested in fuel cell technology. Especially=
=20
for facilities like hospitals, the attributes of low noise and near-zero=20
pollution are very appealing.

Currently, fuel cells are being tested and developed by laboratories and=20
think tanks around the world, hoping to make this low-polluting form of=20
generation available for widespread use by 2002 or 2003. Under the DOE=20
grant, money provided for stationary fuel cells will fund research and=20
development to reduce costs and improve performance. It is hoped that this=
=20
will lead to market-ready fuel cell power systems within three years. In=20
addition, the funding allocates $41.5 million to transportation fuel cell=
=20
research such as integrating fuel cell stacks with fuel processors and=20
balance-of-plant technologies for testing. This program also will examine=
=20
the technology barriers to fuel-flexible systems for automobile application=
s.=20
The $5.5 million reserved for buildings will go toward developing a prototy=
pe=20
fuel processor, completing the design competition for a 50kW co-generator=

for buildings, and other research and development.

Deregulation has cast light on alternative forms of power supply. As=20
customers=20
possibly decide to use on-site generation as opposed to power delivered=20
across a transmission grid, this dramatically alters the traditional busine=
ss=20
of most energy companies. Large commercial and industrial customers that=20
suddenly opt for fuel cell solutions to their energy needs would have=20
dramatic=20
financial impact on their incumbent energy provider. As a result, many=20
electric utilities and energy providers are investing in fuel cells as=20
a hedge against a possible shrinkage within their own supply businesses.=20
Southern Company is a good example. Just this month, Southern joined Alabam=
a=20
Municipal Electric Authority, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International, Inc., and=
=20
FuelCell Energy in a partnership to ""drive a growing interest in fuel cell=
=20
technology."" Specifically, Southern is providing funding for a fuel cell=20
plant to be located in the service territory of Alabama Power, a Southern=
=20
subsidiary. The plant will convert pipeline natural gas into electricity=20
at a reported efficiency of about 50 percent, compared with 33 percent=20
for conventional generation, which will feed the power distribution system=
=20
of Mercedes-Benz.

Another example is Enron, which just two weeks ago entered into an alliance=
=20
with FuelCell Energy, Inc., to develop and market FuelCell Energy's Direct=
=20
FuelCell products, focusing on state renewable and energy conservation=20
programs. As part of the partnership, Enron is investing about $5 million=
=20
in the common stock of FuelCell Energy. In its announcement of the=20
partnership,=20
Enron stated that ""the transaction enables us to reach the developing marke=
ts=20
for clean energy and renewable energy, which may be served through=20
distributed=20
generation products, such as fuel cells.""

These are just two examples of many energy companies that are devoting=20
money to fuel cells and other forms of distributed generation. Some state=
=20
regulatory commissions have debated whether or not to allow utilities to=20
own their own distributed generation equipment technologies. As a result,=
=20
we are seeing a trend of utilities investing in companies that are already=
=20
developing distributed generation solutions, instead of doing it themselves=
.

The investment appears to be a smart one. According to Stephens, Inc.,=20
an investment banking firm, common industry projections put the potential=
=20
for the automotive fuel cell market at $50 billion annually by 2020 and=20
as high as $100 billion (cumulative) for the stationary power markets withi=
n=20
10 years. The increase is due in large part to the growth of Internet-based=

Microturbines=01*small generators that can produce enough power for a small=

by the likes of Capstone, Caterpillar and Solar Turbines. Microturbines=20

emissions. Many energy companies and power marketers such as Williams,=20
Alliant Energy and American Energy Savings have made announcements just=20
within the last month that they will market microturbines to customers.=20
Yet, the distributed generation market should become much tighter once=20

strongly encouraged to attend.

Each of the attorneys should have already received a package that includes 
the complete text of the CFMA, as well as the text of the Commodity Exchange 
Act, black-lined to show how it has been revised by the CFMA.  Please let me 
know if you have not received this package.

Enron, do you want war in Florida?

You're going to get it! Take your fat, lawsuit-happy-pig Eric Thode and get 
the fuck out of South Florida!

Take your greedy peaker plants and build them in India where you already 
have a track record of beating and helping to kill locals who protested you 
there.

The nerve of you pricks trying to build plants in family communities and on 
the edge of our National Park.

We will stop you!

Vince:

I did get the proposal out today, but after close of business your time.
Sorry for the brief delay.  You will find two attachments.  The first is our
time and materials contract, which will need to be executed if you want to
do the test project.  The second is an addendum to that time and materials
contract under Section H, which allows for specific work statements to amend
and supersede the general consulting agreement.  The general consulting
agreement (termsandconditions.doc) contains all the confidentiality, billing
rate, and other provisions that your contract people will probably want and
provides a general framework for doing business.  The work statement
(testproject.doc) contains the specific provisions for our standard weeklong
onsite test project.

I hope we get the opportunity to serve you and ultimately to make
MarketPoint available to you.  In light of the contiguity to the holidays, I
dont think it would be realistic to try to schedule this test project before
then, probably from your perpsective as well as ours.  Let's think about
doing it the first opportunity in January if you decide to go forward if
that is OK with you.

All the best.
Dale

Mr. Huang,

We would be happy to demonstrate the features and functionality of the
WeatherDelta tool set for your team at Enron.  Early next week (Tuesday or
Wednesday) are both possible, as well as early the following week.  The
demonstration can take 90 minutes or more, depending on the number of
questions and the level of detail.

Ideally, you could provide us with some of your data and we could
demonstrate how to value a full-requirements contract to service that
particular load.  To do this we will need one or more years of hourly
consumption data, and the general location of the load.  Ideal data formats
are csv files of either 365 rows x 25 columns (date,hr1,hr2..) or 8760 rows
x 3 columns (date,hr,load).  In lieu of using your data, we will provide
sample load data.

Please feel free to call me and we can discuss schedules and the particulars
of the product overview and demonstration.

Thank you for your interest,

Michael J. Denton

Lee, Chris and Kay:

Attached is a draft of the Change Order #3 for the Las Vegas Cogen project.
Kay, I will be in Houston on Monday through Wednesday afternoon, but will be
busy most of Tuesday.  Lee had hoped that we could get together, or at least
talk, about this and the facility agreement and payment for Change Order #2.
How is your late Monday afternoon looking?

Subject: Reminder


Good afternoon,

I just want to give you a reminder about the one-page questionnaire
regarding arrival and departure times for the workshop.  Your responses
will make planning a bit easier on this end.  Also, please get me your
""one-page"" background statement as soon as possible.  I am attaching
Michael Froehl's to give you some guidance (thanks Michael, I thought I was
going to have to prepare mine first).

Let me also tell you that the television producer has requested 15 minutes
of each of your time either the morning of the 23rd before the luncheon or
after the workshops to do individual interviews.  They will then work these
individual shots into the final edited program (bring your best TV smiles).
 By the way, I have been assured by the producer that we have final say
over whether particular comments are edited in or out of the final product
so we can all relax, this is not live TV.

I'll be out of town the end of next week but hope to have all my plans put
together the following week so please respond to both the questionnaire and
the request for a one-page background/positions/ideas write-up.

Thanks guys and I'm looking forward to seeing you all very soon.

John

p.s. In case you've misplaced it I have appended a copy of the questionnaire.

Subject:Re: Valuation

Steve,


Please, let  me know when you come back.

I have detected a tendency to implement different

approaches to valuation in the past.


To some extent, it reflects the absence of formal

rules for sign-off on the valuation techniques

which, in turn, reflects,  the turf wars and the desire by the

originators to control the outcomes.

Subject:  Valuation



Vince,


I'd like an opportunity to talk to you about valuation.


I'm hearing confusing messages about the way that the UK IT team and the UK

traders get their Valuation code aparently signed off by Research, while

here... You provide it for our guys to wrap up.


We have now a situation where the UK team are using a home grown Valuation

piece called DOVE, where results differ from those of the equivalent USA

portcalc.


I need to break through the pride barriers and the ""not built here""

syndrome, and try to do the right thing, but I don't beleive I can do that

without you guidance.


I'm scared that if we diverge too much we will never work globally on these

systems.

We had a successful off-site in Miami this weekend.  We reviewed all of the=

 I have had several additional discussions on our Global weather business a=

development and execution of our global strategy and positions.   I have a=

great deal of confidence and am holding Mark Tawney responsible and=20
accountable for extensive growth and profitability in the business on a=20
global basis.

We need to hire additional people to add to grow the business in Japan and=

with them to accomplish the hiring of people and needed resources.  This wi=

On the Norway front, we need to implement the same organization structure. =

well.   Jeff did have a video call with Thor last week to talk about his=20
email and it went well.  Upon my return from London, I learned that Thor an=

the London group put out a press release about putting out pricing on about=

1,000 new products on 15 cities and even changing the index.  Neither Mark=

nor Jeff were even aware of this event nor was it even brought up in the ca=
ll=20
as something that was going to happen.  Also the hiring of Lars Elmlund as =
a=20
weather  originator, without any discussion, also illustrates the lack of=
=20
communication or desire to work together.  I am not saying that Mark or Tho=
r=20
are totally to blame, they both deserve credit for not working together, bu=
t =20
we are going to change the future and make sure that it will work better.  =
I=20
know that all of Thor's group is very loyal to Thor and the weather guys ma=
y=20
not want to transition into EGM.  If that is the case, we can make it work=
=20
via London.  I think the key is our approach to Thor and that this isn't=20
meant as a reflection on him but is a change that is consistent with how we=
=20
are running all of our EGM businesses around the world.  The specific weath=
er=20
piece of his business is very small and isn't going to effect his P&L=20
significantly (he'll actually be net positive!).

I certainly want to do this with the least impact on the rest of your=20
organization.  Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues=20
surrounding this new structure and the best way to communicate it to those=

involved in order to implement this in the most effective manner.

The following should be accomplished by Wednesday, to meet the upload 
deadline. I realise this is a tight deadline and appreciate your cooperation 
in addressing these concerns, which have only just recently come to light.

1) In the attached spreadsheet, identify the GTC which covers each Product 
Type for the GTC's which you have written.



note I have completed the first U.S. Natgas as an example.

Please email your update on this spreadsheet to Andrew Thomas.

2) The MasterProductData Spreadsheet (MPS) is attached. It contains a tab 
called Shortdesc. This tab shows a list of Product Types and an index of  
Product Additional Information (PAI) fields which apply to each Product Type. 
There are further tabs on the spreadsheet which correspond to the PAI's. The 
descriptions which appear to the customers on the website will be comprised 
of the Product description on the LongDesc tab and the descriptions from the 
applicable parts of the applicable PAI tabs.  I have confirmed that this 
spreadsheet contains all comments received to date, excluding financials, 
which we are working on seperately. 



Following is a suggested process:

-  List all of the variables in the GTC which would need to be quantified or 
defined in the MPS. Think of the MPS as being the equivalent of the trader's 
conversation with the customer (which is reflected in a final confirmation), 
which covers the commercial, specific terms of the deal.

- Compare this list with the MPS. Confirm that the language of the MPS 
conforms with the requirements of the GTC. Rember to check both the Product 
description found on the LongDesc tab as well as the tabs for each of the 
PAI's for that Product. The PAI's for each Product are listed on the 
ShortDesc page.

- Don't worry about any missing entries for index types, locations, etc. 
These should be filled for accuracy and completeness by the confirmations 
groups. Any changes you make to Products language will be incorporated into 
any new additions.

- Make any changes on the spreadsheet using a red font to highlight and email 
it back to Andrew Thomas.

3) Once the above is complete, and all additions from the confirmations 
groups have been incorporated, we will email back a complete set for final 
approval.

Thanks,

Dave

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Interesting bit from SCE's MOU (p. 31) -

""the CPUC Implementing Decisions shall include

Orders resolving the responsibility of SCE to provide credits to direct 
access customers in respect of electricity deliveries after December 31, 2000 
in respects which do not result in any material financial detriment to SCE; ""

Translation:  I suppose this means SCE is looking for an order absolving it 
of any responsibility for PX credits after 12/31/00, but implicitly, that 
seems to suggest they accept responsibility for PX credits before 12/31/00.  
Do you agree?

Subject: Compound Model for Reedy Creek

Alex,

Paulo and I have continued to look at the model and have come up with a 
couple of additional changes.

1.   The cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike 
payment.   Also, Paulo is trying to clarify if the cashflows should be 
discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values.
2.  I would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree 
approach to a one-dimensional integration, perhaps using a quadrature 
method.  This may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities.
3.  Edith is supposed to check and see if the theoretical gamma is used for 
anything.   If it is, we will probably need to revisit the gamma calculation 
since we are not currently including any cross terms for gamma.

Thanks,

Stinson

A Syrian, Egyptian and Lebanese memorandum of understanding to transport, 
market natural gas
Regional, Economics, 12/16/2000
In the presence of the Lebanese prime minister Rafik al- Hariri a memorandum 
of understanding was signed on Friday in Beirut between Syria, Egypt and 
Lebanon on the transportation and marketing of natural gas.

On the Syrian side the memo. Was signed by minister of oil Maher Jammal and 
minister of oil in Egypt Sameh Fahmi and the Lebanese side was attended by 
Muhammad Abdul hamid Beydoun, the minister of energy and waters, in the 
presence of the secretary general of the Syrian- Lebanese higher council Nasr 
al-Kouri.

The project aims at transporting Egyptian and Syrian gas prepared for 
exportation to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and European countries to market it to 
meet the local demands of gas in these countries.

In a statement to pressmen following the signing ceremony, the Egyptian 
minister said the pipeline worth US $ 1 billion and that it would start near 
al-Arish in Egypt in Northern Egypt and run under the waters of the 
Mediterranean to Lebanon and Turkey through Syria.

The Syrian minister stressed the importance of the project which constitutes 
a turning point in boosting joint regional Arab co-operation and which 
signifies a vivid example on integrated Arab economy.

For his part, the Lebanese minister said that this project will strengthen 
the economic potentials of the participating countries and have positive 
impact on their general conditions.

Hi,

     How are you?  Thank you kindly for your email.  Sorry I have not
responded
sooner.

     Currently I am working in Derivatives Structured Products and Risk
Management at BNP Paribas in London.  Although I currently enjoy living and
working in London, I may need to return to the states - because of my
mother's
failing health.

     Do you know of any good contacts at investment banks that I may
forward my
details to?

     For your information, I have attached my CV.  (Please see attached

     Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

     How are you?  It was nice to meet you at the Real Options conference
in
NYC.

     I was intrigued by some of the comments in your conference talk.  In
particular, by your use of real options to hedge financial options.  This
is
something I am interested in as well.

     When you have some time, could we chat about this topic in a bit more

     Thanks for your time and consideration.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Subject: Cargil Guaranty

These are the changes that Cargill wanted to Enrons outgoing form of 
Guaranty.  I also attached the redline version of the draft with Cargill's 
changes.





1.  In the WHEREAS clause, a number of Cargill entities and a number of
Enron entities are listed, as are a number of different types of
transactions.  You should review this carefully to make certain all
appropriate entities are listed, as are all different types of
transactions.

2.  Paragraph 1 - Third Line - add after ""Counterparty"" "",its successors and
assigns,"".

3.  Paragraph 1 (b) - add the following after ""($20,000,000.00)"" "", together
with reasonable attorney fees (and other reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses) of Counterparty incurred in the enforcement of this Guaranty.""

4.  Paragraph 6(b) before ""presentment"" add ""dilligence"".

5.  Paragraph 6 - Third Paragraph - Second line - delete ""immediately"".
 Also - typo at end of line.

6.  Paragraph 6 - Third Paragraph - 5th line - Replace ""five (5)"" with
""fifteen (15)"".

7.  Paragraph 6 - 5th line Delete ""such"".

8.  Replace Paragraph 7 with the following:  ""The Guarantor further
agrees that all payments made by the Company to Counterparty on any
Obligation hereby guaranteed will, when made, be final and agrees that
if any such payment is recovered from, or repaid by, Counterparty in
whole or in part as a result of any final court order in any
bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar proceeding instituted by or against
the Company, this guarantee shall continue to be fully applicable to
such obligation to the same extent as though the payment so recovered
or repaid had never been originally made on such obligation.  However,
in no event shall this provision be interpreted to allow Counterparty
to recover more from the Guarantor, Company, or any combination of the
payments from both such parties, than the Company's total obligations
under the Agreement hereby guaranteed.""

9.  Paragraph 8 - Replace ""Texas"" law with ""New York"" law.

Doug Leach call me  this morning and told me that the offer that he made to 
the LNG group 6 months ago is now off the table. He said that this has also 
been transmitted to Mike McConnell in writing. His reason was that he had 
bent over backwards to make the proposal originally and the LNG group has 
been slow to respond. I reminded him that we were delayed in getting back 
because of some legal issues but now that we were all part of EGM that this 
was no longer an issue. He went on to say that he will not turn over any of 
the fees until phase 2 kicks in, some time next year (Marc de La Roche said 
something to me the other day about Jan.01). That the LNG group will have to 
bear all expenses until that time just like EFI had to for liquid fuels. He 
did say that in their case India did reimburse them on their previous 
expenses as a reduction/credit to the fee. He also went on to say that he was 
not happy with India's attempt to get a piece of EFI's fee.
Please advise how you would like me to proceed.

Subject: Electricity price volatility


Dear Dr. Kaminski,
I'm an economist (M.Sc., Caltech, Ph.D., Iowa) who has been working for the
Alberta government for the last seven years on electricity deregulation in
Alberta, Canada. I have been looking for research papers on the measurement
and causes of price volatility in electricity markets.

As a policy maker, I am interested in the implications of government policy
decisions on price volatility. As an economist who has had a hand in
designing the electricity markets here, I am also interested in how the
design of electricity markets and the associated institutions affect price
volatility.

I've found two references to a seminar talk you have given recently at
Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon called ""Volatility of Electricity Prices -
Measurement and  Analysis of Underlying Causes."" (I've also found a
multitude of references to other work that you've done, but this seemed
closest to what I'm looking for.)

Was there a paper associated with your talk that I could get a copy of? Any
help you can give me on finding information on this topic would be greatly
appreciated.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Sid Carlson

Subject: Re: ClickPaper.com
  

First, thanks for jumping in on this.  I am confident we can get it done even 
though it will be a fire drill.

We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there, it was 
just being held or managed in four places.  It will all  be pulled together 
by Monday in one place (one complete document) and will have about 15 major 
categories with specific tasks under each category with status, person 
responsible, comments and date to be completed.  It will also have a complete 
timeline. We can review that Monday and agree on its content.  Louise agreed 
to review it as well.

As it relates to the people you mentioned, let me know how and/or who you 
want to pull in after we agree on the control document.  That way we will 
know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them.

Salley Beck called (she mentioned you had called her as well) and we agreed 
that the ClickPaper's back office representative would officially be Scott 
Earnest (he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with 
him for months).  She is going to get in place people to be our Product 
Control Group for CP launch on July 24th.  Scott and Salley will work to 
source it so that we have 3 or 4 people trained and ready on the 24th to 
receive password applications, create customer profiles on ClickPaper and 
start the applications through credit, legal and tax and finally get out user 
IDs to clients.  We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their 
people unless there is some emergency.  Remember, we are only setting up 
people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified.

We also have a help desk person starting next week.  I don't have his name 
yet, but we have him and one more on the way.  We will create for them a 
brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can.

I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave.  We walked inch by inch 
through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done.  We have a 
few holes, but it is not that far away.  She is going to think about a 
process document for this and get back to me Monday.  I have a detailed EOL 
one and we will give it our shot this weekend.

Let me know what Mark Palmer says.  He knows we have been using Margaret.  We 
will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan 
and what she needs to do.  We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive 
mailing ( a letter) that does not include temporary IDs/passwords.  We will 
tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers, we want to use 
this time to get them pre-registered.  Besides, there is no way to test a 
1000 temporary IDs anyway.  We will send those out later.  as I said earlier, 
the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area (or garden as 
Lousie would call it) by next for Friday or the following Monday. That way 
people can surf the content and get registered.

On legal, I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we 
had a detailed discussion today about the contracts, what is needed and the 
deadline. There is legal work left to do ( the current draft of the password 
application doesn't work), but if Taylor can help, that would be great.  We 
will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday.

I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy (with Bob Crane and 
Hal as well) to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control 
issues associated with it.  Credit is fine, we have been working with 
Bradford for months, but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual 
posting. I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and 
views.

The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all 
their comments by the end of next week. They will also be given the complete 
Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to 
help the roll out.  We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday, July 
22nd for the final testing of the system.

Remember, the 24th is a one (Enron)-to-many launch with a financial market 
only.  ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section, Enron is so 
it is simply a new distribution channel for Enron's existing financial 
offering.  Later, we will build it out for physical (probably sooner rather 
than later).  Finally, I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop 
but Louise said today that is October or November.  It will only be 
many-to-many if someone comes in and makes a compelling case ($$$) to do so.

Thanks.

See you tomorrow.

Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.

I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, 
personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another 
good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and 
assignments.
Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very 
smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and 
he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a 
couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse 
engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has 
others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his 
existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper 
already).
Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the 
short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she 
could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good 
option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary 
Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck 
(advice and discuss additional resources).
I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick 
thoughts on process and lessons learned.
I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early 
versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.
I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the 
marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure 
that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John 
Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday 
afternoon.
Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to 
add a trading perspective?

A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.

 1. Enron over the past decade has become the most vigorous change agent
 in its industry.  From a leadership perspective, how have you created a
 culture of change in an industry not known for change?

 2. Nortel Networks has clearly made an outstanding transformation into
 the New Economy, similar to Enron's evolution. In Nortel's case, John Roth
 bought Bay Networks and infused the Nortel culture with Bays - almost a
 reverse cultural transformation.  How did you create a New Economy culture
 where innovation, risk-taking and new ideas are embraced and rewarded?

 3. Are there some best practices you can share with other CEOs and
 Managing Directors regarding leading a change?

 4. At best, change is difficult. But being able to change before you
 have to has only been accomplished successfully by a few companies.  How
 did you lead a change effort when you were arguably still a very
 successful utility?

 5. Peter Drucker has said than in stable time you need good management
 but in disruptive times you need leadership.  How have you been able to
 attract and retain what Fortune magazine has called the best management
 team?

 6. The New Economy is really all about creating a culture of
 innovation, where employees see opportunity and not barriers. Enron has
 been masterful at this from gas, to electricity, pulp & paper, and now
 bandwidth. As the ""keeper of the culture"" how did you establish and
 maintain such a culture?

 7. As Enron moves away from Plant, Property and Equipment towards
 Intangible Assets, what has changed for you as a leader in the age of
 intangibles?

 8. Can you list the four or five ""must have"" competencies for the 21st
 Century CEO? What experiences are necessary?

 9. Lets talk about going global. You have made very impressive in-roads
 in India where no other utility has been able to. How did you lead this
 effort? Are there any best practices you can share with your fellow CEO's
 who are thinking about India?

 10. Lets now move to Europe. Enron is the largest gas and power trader
 in Europe. Can you discuss your move into Europe? Again are there some

		 Subject: tax issues

Sue--a suggestion for discussion at our next weekly call.  As one of our 
Illinios IXC certification reporting requirements, EBS must file an 
application/registration with the Illinois Dept of Revenue and presumably 
will need to pay taxes to the the State of Illinois.  Our lawyer passed on 
the form to be completed, and Tracy had sent it to the tax department in 
Portland.  There seems to be ongoing confusion as to who should actually file 
this document (I would argue that the EBS tax department is the group that 
needs to do so, as well as establish an ongoing relationship with the folks 
at the Dept of Revenue) and who administratively needs to set up a system to 
handle any interaction with the Revenue dept. 

Since our IXC certifcations have only started to take place in 2000 this 
issue may not have hit the tax department before,  but I've got to believe 
that just about every state in the union is going to want to tax us on 
something, so I think we need to explore the issue further.  Could you please 
add to our agenda for next week?

it make this K a little broader for all transactions?

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana

has left the Company and that she had not begun the analysis for Managers and 
above.

Todd Burke, who recently joined Enron, will be conducting the market survey 
and compensation analysis.  I met with Todd recently.  He has had wonderful 
experience with Towers Perin and Watson Wyatt, and I feel that we are 
fortunate to have him devoted to this project.  Please give sufficient 
thought and attention to requests from Todd.  The quality and timeliness of 
your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the 
analysis that I will receive from Todd.  I think that you should each have a 
vested interest in the success of this project!

Todd also plans to resurvey market information for Senior Specialists and 
below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of 
Energy Operations.  Since we recently took action on compensation levels for 
key players at the Senior Specialist level and below, I would not anticipate 
further adjustments for those levels as a result of Todd's review.

You should receive a message from Todd in the next day or so in which he will

Subject: New Entex G.M. Deal starting August 99


Jackie/Gerald
We have done a term deal with Entex Gas Marketing starting August 1, 1999. 
The term is for one year and will end July 31, 2000. This is a point specific 
deal. The delivery point is meter 8078/ Rhone Poulen Chemical Plant (Rhodia). 
The receipt points will be meter 4132/ Exxon Katy Plant Tail Gate, meter 
6780/ Oasis Katy, meter 0067/ Lone Star Katy, meter 0072/ Western Katy. The 
out rate at meter 8078 is $.075. The in rate at meters 4132, 6780, 0067, & 
0072, is $.03. This deal was done for full plant requirements up to 1,750 
MMBtus/day. We have a Intrastate Master receipt/delivery contract already set 
up with Entex Gas Marketing (012-27106-02-001). I would like for us to do a 
confirmation for this deal under this contract, and assign it a different 
number for scheduling to schedule on. Please let me know what this number 
will be so I can make all parties aware.


Kent,
If you see anything above that does not look right to you please give me a

Tanya/Sara/Tom:

I spoke with David Porter, the credit person at Glencore Ltd., last Friday 
and inquired about Glencore AG's relation to Glencore Ltd., with which we 
have a master swap.  He indicated to me quite emphatically that Glencore 
Ltd., Glencore AG, and Glencore SA are one in the same.  He explained that 
when documents of incorporation were filed with the country of Switzerland, 
this one corporation registered three names which it uses to do business on a 
regional basis.  He faxed over some documents to that effect.  He indicated 
that while Glencore Ltd., the branch arm doing business here in the states 
has the master, the master should cover Glencore AG, since it is the same 
company only the European branch.  He has even offered to work on an 
amendment to the master to cover the addition of the second name, Glencore 
AG..

Sara, I will send you the documentation that David Porter faxed me.  Please 
let me know your opinion of the information contained.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Subject: Open items for MDEA

[Fairley, David]  


Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:


1. How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?
[Fairley, David]  
Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the 
appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model.  As conditions change the utilities 
must update this info.  We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel 
usage.  Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a 
quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used 
are satisfactiry -- it can never be exact, but it should be accurate within a 
band of acceptability.  No GADS.  Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as 
often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient 
temps..

2. Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, their units are too small.  We have discussed this with the customer, 
and with our internal air permit guys.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  They have Title V permits, and they are faxing them to 
us today.  They have no run hour limitations on gas, however, they are 
limited on oil.  Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible.


3. We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We won't buy and sell fuel oil.  We may dispatch on oil at start-up, or we 
may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable, which constitutes a Product 
transaction with the resulting profit split.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible 
for maintaining fuel oil supplies.

4. We aren't making money on gas, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We make money on gas two ways.  The first is outside the contract, and is 
basicly any internal profit on re-sale of gas to the Cities.  The second way 
we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product 
trade, and those procedures apply.

5. Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in 
to the picture?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, will send separately.

6. Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  
[Fairley, David]  
The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of 
Asset Management have been upated.  The other Exhibits have not been 
modified.  The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been 
discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their 
comments/questions incorporated.
  
 

7. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.  
[Fairley, David]  
Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the 
parties.  Will look at it again.  Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and 
Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract 
language is clear enough.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example.

 Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of 
power)? 
[Fairley, David]  
There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, 
(2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for 
imbalances?  Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their 
Network Services Agreement.  EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource 
items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances.  
Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances 
(they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly 
desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions 
and obligations of the parties.  A different section in the contract states 
that MDEA wears the exposure.

 How are we setting the bogey?    Formula?   [Fairley, David]  The bogey is 
set when the load projection and stack models are run each day.  Both parties 
participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and 
planning the day's activities.  
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Records of bogey decisions will be archieved

Subject to audit?  [Fairley, David]    Yes, but they would be auditing 
something that is jointly derived each day.  Frankly, they would like to have 
less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them 
to participate and buy in every day.  

Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?
[Fairley, David]  
One bogey for power.  Gas is an input for determining the bogey.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Bogey set day-ahead.

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  
[Fairley, David]  
This is in the pricing calc's.  Should we have a definition?

What costs are included on the buy and sell side [Fairley, David]  see cost 
definition being provided separately.
 



Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used. 
[Fairley, David]    See definition in my mark-up's to the main agreement. 

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits. 
[Fairley, David]   Services and Orig are reviewing these, but other than what 
was mentioned above, probably no changes unless you see a specific area that 
is a problem. 

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?
[Rorschach, Reagan]  I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily 
and monthly.  We need to make sure to limit our info providing 
responsibilities to those reports.

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: 20/20 Update

I spoke with Karry regarding the outstanding issues related to 20/20.   He 
said that the items that were on item B on my issues schedule for Natural Gas 
Revenues for $989k were ENA paying Northern Border.  The $309k in item F were 
Northern Border paying ENA.  This would change the post closing adjustment by 
a net of about $680k.  I will work through the new calculation with the items 
identified.

Also, he said that he thought ENA's Gas accounting group, Scott Sitter and 
someone from Denver should meet to go through the adjustments and payments 
that have gone through since the closing.  This could affect the post closing 
calculation with fairly significant dollars and would be information that I 
would not have.  

Cris - I am attaching a schedule that I believe Karry used to get to the 
basis for the initial gain calculation.  It is on the tab ""P&S Combined"".

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and 
complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.  At the risk 
of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions 
with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control.  
Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial 
people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back 
and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and 
standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it 
helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the 
long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, 
less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc. 

A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get 
in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth 
et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized 
delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't 
quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish 
some of these goals as well.

In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.  

Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.

Subject: Reporting Structure

Dave, at the risk of rocking the boat, I would like you to consider the 
following. As you know, with the exception of Origination & Finance, all 
other Canadian departments (Trading, Legal, Ops, Acctg, HR, Govt, & IT) 
report directly to someone in Houston while having a dotted line to me. 

In my mind, this is completely backwards (ie. it should be a solid line to 
me, and a dotted line to their respective counterparts in Houston) for the 
following reasons. First, performance feedback is not communicated to these 
individuals in a timely manner if at all. Even when it is, more times than 
not, it is perfunctory in nature. In fact, I think that feedback is given 
somewhat reluctantly because the manager  in Houston has really no idea 
whether the individual in Canada is doing a good job or not. 

Second, it is sub-optimal. I seem to be spending more and more time dealing 
with issues between the Canadian employee and their respective manager in 
Houston. Many of these conversations revolve around my first point. Case and 
point, we almost lost Laura Scott earlier this year because she was feeling 
unappreciated and felt that her boss had no idea the hours/effort she was 
putting in. And just yesterday, I had a very unsatisfactory phone call with 
Mark Haedicke regarding Peter Keohane. The result - I now have a very 
demotivated lawyer on my hands.

Third, it is costly. Having senior people fly up to Calgary/Toronto to ""stay 
in the loop"" and to complete performance reviews is both costly from both a 
dollar and time perspective.  

Frankly, I'm not looking for more performance reviews to do, but I do think 
its important that staff receive meaningful feedback in a timely fashion. I 
know what these people do - I work with them every day. It is my job to lead, 
inspire, and motivate but lately it feels like it is my job to liase between 
Houston and the employee.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this.

Regards
Milnthorp

		 Subject: Las Vegas Cogen - Nevada Power Response to RFP

In a mad dash to meet the RFP response deadline, a draft of the Response to 
RFP to be submitted by Las Vegas Cogeneration Limited Partnership and ENA to 
Nevada Power is attached.

The Response to RFP is due tomorrow by overnight delivery.

This is my first foray into the EEI Master, and particularly in connection 
with unit-firm power / tolling contracts.  I would greatly appreciate a 
review and comment by Shari and/or Elizabeth, given the size and duration of 
the proposed transaction.  One of the attachments is a partial cover sheet 
reflecting certain of the changes to the documents requested by Nevada 
Power.  The full list of requests, as incorporated into the RFP form, is 
attached for reference.  

I am not satisfied with the provisions of the ""unit firm"" contract regarding 
availability/power delivery.  We need to adequately document that the plant 
is allowed to be off-line, and not to make power deliveries, during 
maintenance periods.  The ""unit firm"" definition should cover other 
unscheduled outages.  Suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Please note that the form of ISDA contract is not attached.  I understand 
Tracy has done the credit worksheet, and I hope to have a copy of the 
contract for attachment by noon tomorrow.  

Apologies to all for the rushed nature of this project.  It has been one of 
those things.  Your help is greatly appreciated.

After the demo, if both of you think it is a great tool, then I am going to

Per my voice mail to Vince, Martin Lins offer letter will be provided to him 
on Thursday, August 31, 2000. 

However, a concern was shared regarding the retention bonus we originally 
discussed.  Therefore, based on his PHD and market information we are able to 
offer him a base salary of 98-100K and no retention bonus.  We can discuss 
retention bonus after he begins his manager role in your group.

If you would like to discuss further please feel free to call me.  Otherwise, 
please approve salary structure of base 98,000 with no bonus.

Thank you.

Attached to the email is what I believe to be the proper form of notice to 
take something out of TurboPark.  Five to fifteen business days' notice is 
required.

There will be other documents involved as well:

Bill of Sale
Assignment and Assumption Agreement
UCC releases, if applicable (UCC filings are made on all delivered equipment)

I suspect a consent by the equipment seller may also be required.  More to 
come on this one.

notices - one for CA I and one for CA II.  Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please 
prepare a draft of the two exhibits?
 
Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the 
participation agreement and the development and construction management 
agreement.  

I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.  By my calculations, 
Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an 
option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th.  

Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a ""release letter"" for the banks 
and/or DevCo. It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section 
in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm 
still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet.  
Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with 
the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue.

I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement.


Thanks,

Kay

I checked with Heather, and it turns out this second NCPA counterparty 
shortname was set up to distinguish between two different SC numbers. But 
it's only for internal use - both counterparty names have the same billing 
information, etc. So Heather said the deals are fine as they are. I'm going 
to find out more about this after the afternoon rush dies down - just so 
we'll know for the future when to use which shortname.

These two deals are entered with a special counterparty name that looks like 
it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty 
name out there that looks just the same only without the very last series of 
letters.  I will check here and see if anyone knows the difference.  There is 
a note in the Global System that says Heather Dunton had this CP set up.  If 
you could check with her and see if it should be used for these deals or if 
the other CP should be used.

a Copper Transaction we have traded with them.  Per the desks instructions I 
have not sent our form of Confirmation for several reasons as follows:

1) Trader wrote on ticket that MG was to Confirm the Transactions
2) We were unsure of MG's Legal entity name
3) No contact @ MG

I understand that Ken Lay will officially open the Enron Japan office around

exhibit to the EPC contract, and we would like to have the executed version 
for our file.

No pressure - just a request for status and a heads up as to what is ongoing 
with the LVCII project.

Cheers

Bill W.

And the Matt-Bob deal swap - I guess it was just a last minute decision on 
their part, and they should have let the broker know. Matt said the trade 
needs to stay in Bob's book, and just to check it out as a good trade with 
EPMI. Let me know if you still have problems with this.

Are you talking about the broker fee?
Yes the fee is $15.00 Flat per Bloomberg's confirmation on both of these 
deals.

PREBON
Bob said Matt Motley gave him this deal to do. Is that going to fly with 
Prebon?
I guess this is o.k. but they were insisting that this deal was done with

Subject: RW separations

Michelle,

Please let know what you thing regarding the following:

1) Two of the RW employees have called asking about their Cobra coverage and 
whether or not they are due money for the coverage.  One could argue ( and 
they obviously are ) that health and welfare coverage constitutes part of 
their employment and should be paid to them as part of their separation.

If we provide it to one then we really need to be consistent and apply it to 
everyone.  I'm sure they are speaking to each other on a daily basis.

2) Russell Gilardi's attorney has made comment that one could interpret his 
contract to mean that he has a fixed term contract through the end of the 
year.  Here is the wording verbatim: 

'Commencing on your agreement to the terms of this letter, both you and the 
Company will be required to give not less than 3 months notice in writing to 
terminate your employment, such notice to expire at any time on or after 1st 
January 2001.'

I think Hoyt missed this last part when he sent you the info for the 
separation agreements.  For your info, other RW employees with this 
particular type of wording had their contracts fully paid out.

3) Joel Insinga is requesting that his non-compete be reduced from 6 months 
to 3 months.   He was with MG for a little over a month.  I've asked the SVP 
of the division for his thoughts and should hear something tomorrow.   

Thanks and hopefully we are nearing the end.!

Cathy

Jim, my understanding is that there continues to be some discussion on 
whether there will be functional seperation of the retail and wholesale 
businesses and to what extent and under what strategy these are undertaken.  
I am not sure that we want to put ourselves in a box under any structure 
until these things are completely ironed out eg) country managers et al.  I'm 
not in agreement with any memo that further details the organization beyond 
what was outlined in the original memo.  However, I am in agreement that this

Subject: Re: ClickPaper.com
  

First, thanks for jumping in on this.  I am confident we can get it done even 
though it will be a fire drill.

We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there, it was 
just being held or managed in four places.  It will all  be pulled together 
by Monday in one place (one complete document) and will have about 15 major 
categories with specific tasks under each category with status, person 
responsible, comments and date to be completed.  It will also have a complete 
timeline. We can review that Monday and agree on its content.  Louise agreed 
to review it as well.

As it relates to the people you mentioned, let me know how and/or who you 
want to pull in after we agree on the control document.  That way we will 
know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them.

Salley Beck called (she mentioned you had called her as well) and we agreed 
that the ClickPaper's back office representative would officially be Scott 
Earnest (he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with 
him for months).  She is going to get in place people to be our Product 
Control Group for CP launch on July 24th.  Scott and Salley will work to 
source it so that we have 3 or 4 people trained and ready on the 24th to 
receive password applications, create customer profiles on ClickPaper and 
start the applications through credit, legal and tax and finally get out user 
IDs to clients.  We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their 
people unless there is some emergency.  Remember, we are only setting up 
people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified.

We also have a help desk person starting next week.  I don't have his name 
yet, but we have him and one more on the way.  We will create for them a 
brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can.

I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave.  We walked inch by inch 
through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done.  We have a 
few holes, but it is not that far away.  She is going to think about a 
process document for this and get back to me Monday.  I have a detailed EOL 
one and we will give it our shot this weekend.

Let me know what Mark Palmer says.  He knows we have been using Margaret.  We 
will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan 
and what she needs to do.  We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive 
mailing ( a letter) that does not include temporary IDs/passwords.  We will 
tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers, we want to use 
this time to get them pre-registered.  Besides, there is no way to test a 
1000 temporary IDs anyway.  We will send those out later.  as I said earlier, 
the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area (or garden as 
Lousie would call it) by next for Friday or the following Monday. That way 
people can surf the content and get registered.

On legal, I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we 
had a detailed discussion today about the contracts, what is needed and the 
deadline. There is legal work left to do ( the current draft of the password 
application doesn't work), but if Taylor can help, that would be great.  We 
will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday.

I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy (with Bob Crane and 
Hal as well) to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control 
issues associated with it.  Credit is fine, we have been working with 
Bradford for months, but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual 
posting. I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and 
views.

The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all 
their comments by the end of next week. They will also be given the complete 
Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to 
help the roll out.  We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday, July 
22nd for the final testing of the system.

Remember, the 24th is a one (Enron)-to-many launch with a financial market 
only.  ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section, Enron is so 
it is simply a new distribution channel for Enron's existing financial 
offering.  Later, we will build it out for physical (probably sooner rather 
than later).  Finally, I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop 
but Louise said today that is October or November.  It will only be 
many-to-many if someone comes in and makes a compelling case ($$$) to do so.

Thanks.

See you tomorrow.

Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.

I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, 
personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another 
good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and 
assignments.
Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very 
smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and 
he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a 
couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse 
engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has 
others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his 
existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper 
already).
Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the 
short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she 
could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good 
option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary 
Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck 
(advice and discuss additional resources).
I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick 
thoughts on process and lessons learned.
I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early 
versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.
I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the 
marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure 
that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John 
Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday 
afternoon.
Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to 
add a trading perspective?

A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.

Dear Molly,

I asked about change of the departure city.  They said I should send my ticket
back to get a new ticket. Since Aquila provides the ticket, it's hard for me
to change the departing place. If possible, can I ask you to arrange the one
way flight from Houston to Seattle on the evening of 25th?  I'm sorry for
this.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Subject: Re: Greenpeace letters to Enron Europe concerning our position on 
Kyoto  

All:  I would like to discuss how we might respond to this letter from 
Greenpeace, if at all.  The letter is attached way at the bottom of this 
e-mail, and was received in several Enron European offices as a copy of what 
was sent to Jeff Skilling and other CEOs of major companies.  I have not 
confirmed our receipt of such a letter from any of you, but am assuming it 
was delivered.

I think we could respond in a very positive, constructive manner to 
Greenpeace, based on the statements we've already documented and the 
strategies we are developing.  Lisa Jacobson and I are currently working on 
developing some tighter climate change and clean air ""messages"" that we can 
use in multiple areas ASAP -- upcoming Ken Lay speeches and interactions with 
the Administration, revising the Statement for the 2001 Corporate 
Responsibility Report, Enron Business articles and other internal uses, 
responses to environmental group inquiries and shareholder meeting Q&A, and 
use in everyday speeches and advocacy work.

The Greenpeace questions are tricky, and set up no-win answers for the most 
part.  I doubt they will get any direct answers to questions like:  ""Does 
your company support President Bush in his opposition to the protocol?""   In 
my opinion, we can respond to Greenpeace without directly responding to these 
types of questions.  Addressing Kyoto directly is a slippery slope -- its 
best to stick with the solution-oriented approach we've always taken.

For this reason, I was a bit concerned to see in the e-mail chain below a 
characterization of Mark Palmer's statement on Kyoto (given to Jackie Gentile 
in London) -- ""Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was 
not a workable solution to dealing with CO2 emissions.  However it is not the 
principles behind Kyoto that we take issue with, rather it is the vehicle 
that has been devised to deliver the results.""  I believe it is dangerous to 
make such statements for a number of reasons -- Greenpeace would absolutely 
beat us over the head with it, Friends of the Earth could step up its 
shareholder initiatives, etc.    Also, this sets you up for a number of 
follow up questions that I don't think we have answers to, like:  What about 
Kyoto is not workable?  What would make it workable and would we help make it 
workable?  If not Kyoto, what is Enron's preferred ""vehicle?""  I'd really 
rather stay with a constructive, solution-oriented approach and avoid 
reference to Kyoto altogether.

I will talk with Kate Bauer in Enron Europe about this, but I think we need 
to decide on a global, corporate-wide response to Greenpeace.   I would be 
happy to set up a quick conference call on the subject, or just field 
comments by e-mail -- whatever works best.

Thoughts?

Subject:  Re: Greenpeace letters to Enron in the Netherlands and Spain re
      our position on Kyoto

Lauren

Further to my telephone message today, I would be grateful for your view on
the approach we should be taking to the issue of Greenpeace sending letters
to our European offices re: Kyoto. Several of our offices (Spain, Belgium,
Netherlands) have received a local language version of the letter
originally sent to Jeff Skilling, and other CEOs, on 5 April 2001. The
email chain below gives an indication of what is in circulation.

Greenpeace is expecting a response within the next week. Jackie Gentle has
made me the point of contact in the PR department for this issue. We have
discussed this issue briefly and we would support issuing an initial
statement to acknowledge receipt of the letters, perhaps followed by a
standardised, corporate- approved letter, but would like to ensure our
approach is supported, and consistent with any actions, by Corporate. As
some of the countries in which we operate have tangible ""green"" focused
projects e.g. we have acquired a wind project in The Netherlands, it may be
appropriate to allow such countries to personalise their response in local
language.

If we follow up an initial acknowledgement with a fuller response to
Greenpeace's questions, I suggest we consider the following issues raised
recently by Jackie Gentle:

""In response to several requests for clarification, I have spoken with Mark
Palmer who has provided the following information on Enron's stance
regarding Kyoto:

Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was not a workable
solution to dealing with CO2 emissions.  However it is not the principles
behind Kyoto that we take issue with, rather it is the vehicle that has
been devised to deliver the results.

We firmly believe that there is work to be done in reducing greenhouse
gases and Enron has put in place a number of programs that have measurably
reduced carbon dioxide as well as SO2 and Oxides of Nitrogen (Nox)

By way of example ....
   emissions trading programs have been put in place where these can be
   implemented
   Enron is one of the largest developers of natural gas-fired power plants
   which produce about 50 percent less carbon dioxide than coal or
   oil-fired plants
   demand-side management programs through EES to reduce energy usage
   the Catalytica program
   focus on renewable-related projects

At the current time there is no formal statement from Enron Corp on the
Kyoto issue.""

Before we proceed, I would be grateful if you could contact me to share
your views on this.

Many thanks.
Best regards
Kate

letter asap.

In the mean time, I will wait for direction on our official corporate

I have advised Hans-Mart to make sure all employees in the Dutch office do
not reply to any calls or queries re the above ubject and to refer them to

Dear Steven:

Just to refresh your memory ... we met in June to discuss future job
prospects at Enron.  At that time, you had offered to get me in touch with
someone in the Finance Division (?) at Enron to discuss similar topics.  I
am sorry to bother you with matters such as this, but I am still very
interested in a position with Enron and would like to follow through on
this offer, if you are still willing.  As an aside, another contact gave
me the name of Rob Bradley and suggested that I get in touch with him.  I
don't know if that is who you had in mind, or not.

I am moving my wife to Houston next week, and will be available to meet
any time from Friday, August 4 until Thursday, August 10.  After that, I
leave for a conference in Seattle, but will back in Houston for one day on
Thursday, August 17th.

As for my timetable (which at the time you had told me to keep you
apprised of), I will continue in my position at K-State for the Fall
semester.  After that, I'm a free man.  I have a couple of academic offers
for temporary positions in the Spring, one at Rice and one at UT-Austin.
The latter is very appealing, but would require my absence from home
during the weeks.  As such, I am still wide open beginning in January.

In spite of the fact that I awoke at 3:30AM in order to get to the
airport the day that I met Jim Steffes and you, I got a lot out of our
meeting.  I was very impressed with Enron and what you had to say, and am
hopeful about future prospects with the company.  I remain very interested
in a future position at Enron, and perhaps in Public and Government
Affairs (I hope I have that right).

Thank you for everything.  I hope that you had a nice vacation.

Sincerely,

Mike Sadler

Subject: Transport Fuel P/L



Colleen,

After looking into the transport deals for NBPL (long term deal 1,2, 25,26), 
I think I figured it out why
we see positive fuel P/L for deal 1,25,and 26 and negative fuel P/L for deal 
2. 

The following plot shows NYMEX curve as of 8/23/00:




For short term, NYMEX moved up compared to that of 8/22/00, while the long 
term NYMEX moved down.

Here are the tenor for each deal:

Deal 1:   start 01-Sep-00, end 22-May-09,    the above graph suggested a 
positve fuel P/L
Deal 2:   start 01-sep-00, end 28-feb-02,       the above graph suggested a 
small negative P/L
Deal 25: start 01-may-02, end 28-feb-09,      the above graph suggested a 
positve fuel P/L
Deal 26: start 01-mar-09, end 31-may-09,    the above graph suggested a 
positve fuel P/L

The transport book seems to be correct on these fuel P/Ls. 

Another point worth to mention is that the fuel cost is related to index 
price (NYMEX+basis+index premium), to correctly interpret fuel P/L,
we need to look at the index curve change. 

Let me know your thoughts on this.

I have attached the general design we are proposing for the Enron Seminar
Series mug.  We have a little refinement to do - spacing here and there a
couple type-o's but this is the idea.  If you like it, we will put an order 
in.

I'll put out an announcement on the seminar schedule shortly.  So far the
fall line up includes Will Goetzman - Yale, Lenard Mirman - Virgina, Jeff
Pontiff - U. of Washington, George Allyannis - Darden, and Charles Lee -
Cornell.

Thank you.

#562373 was an EOL trade that Chris Mallory did. When it was done on line the 
delivery point was NP-15 now in Enpower it has been changed to SP-15. Could 
you check with Chris if this is correct. I thought that we were not allowed 
to change EOL trades. If he did then I will have to get with Legal to find 
out what our next step would be.

Subject: APEA Gas Sale: Force Majeure by Clark PUD

Dale,

Further to my phone call this morning, I have contacted John Watts at Avista 
requesting a copy of the Force Majeure letter they are sending to APEA.  I 
will forward this as soon as I receive it.  The event in this case is 
preventative maintenance.  It appears that there are stress fractures in 
certain of Clark's generation equipment.  GE is installing equipment to 
assess the problem.  The installation and removal of this equipment will 
involve an outage totaling 5 days over the next 2 weeks.  The question is:  
Is preventative maintenance a legitimate Force Majeure event under the 
APEA/Clark contract and thus under the APEA/ENGMC contract?

Thanks for your help,

Laird

description of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel.  The 
responsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve 
such written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide 
substantial professional services.

 2.  Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised 
written estimate if such outside counsel determines that legal fees and 
expenses for such transaction will exceed the previous written estimate by 
$25,000.00.  Such revised written estimate shall be reviewed and approved by 
the responsible business unit and the General Counsel or his/her designee 
before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial additional 
professional services. 

 3.  In order to accurately track such expenses so that the expenses can be 
properly allocated to the various business units, a work order number should 
be obtained for each transaction.  

 Thank you for your cooperation.  If you have any questions or any other 
suggestions for controlling expenses, please call me at extension 36544.",ENA Legal Expenditures

Subject: RE: Delta docs

Kay,
The deal team needs to sign and send out the notices (for Fountain Valley 
they had V&E do all that).  The notice needs to be faxed to:
Elizabeth Burnett (phone 212-325-9943, fax 212-325-8304) - she is replacing 
Shazia Sarker who (we just found out) is leaving CSFB on Friday.  Shazia's 
name and number need to be changed throughout the documents.  V&E also faxed 
copies of the notices to: Karl Wiemer at Milbank (phone 212-530-5209, fax 
212-822-5209), Lisa, Rose and myself.

The Assignment and Assumption Agreement needs to be signed by the deal team 
for ENA, then sent to Karl Wiemer, Ann Roberts, Jose Mercado and Doneene 
Damon for execution by E-Next Generation LLC (see addresses below).  The Bill 
of Sale also needs to be sent to Karl, Ann, Jose, and Doneene for execution 
by E-Next.

The second notice is called the ""Prepayment Notice"" and includes the amount 
to be funded 2 days later.  I took the V&E form used for Fountain Valley and 
removed names and amounts, however I believe Rose had some additional 
comments, so let me talk to her before attaching a sample Prepayment Notice.  
I'll get back to you shortly.  Thanks.

Hi Catherine,

I don't remember who actually gives the notice, but in anticipation of the 
funding of the escrow tomorrow, here are the docs.

 << File: Final Delta Turbine Sale Turbopark Notice of Purchase.doc >>  << 
File: Final Delta Turbine Sale Turbopark Assignment & Assumption Agmt with GE 
ack.DOC >>  << File: Final Delta Turbine Sale Turbopark Bill of Sale.DOC >> 

I understand there is also a two day notice.  I don't believe I've seen a 
form for that one yet.

Who should send this out tomorrow after we get the fed ref?

Thanks,

Kay

Les -
Here's the latest list of unit contingent deals in need of unit names. I've 
tried referring to your unit name list and entering them myself, but it looks 
like some delivery points correspond to more than one unit. I.E. Navajo can 
originate from LV Cogen OR Saguaro Power. If you could add these unit names 
into the deals, or let me know what they are so I can enter them, it would be 
much appreciated.

Thanks,

After a marathon 12 hour meeting with Assemplyman Keeley, Senator Battin, QF

Per the email below, before we respond to Glencore we just wanted to make 
sure that you haven't made any agreements with Glencore with respect to 
choice of law for the online trades that would subject them to UK law.

I don't want to talk to them without checking with you first since this is 
one of the true counterparties that we are trading with on both sides of the 
Atlantic.

By the way, I heard you had some really good news.  I'm so happy for you!

Hi,

I have received a call from Miriam in Glencore re EOL transactions.  Her 
concerned are that she does not receive the confirmations within 24 Hours 
(from Houston) of the deal being dealt which we are subject to in London and 
she would like to see this from ENA.  Also, when Glencore agreed to trade EOL 
transactions they stipulated that English law be used for all transactions, 
presuming these would be the same from ENA.  She has tried to call but only 
gets voice mail, could you please contact her to discuss these and any other 
issues she has with EOL.

I have looked at the outline of the proposed course and
find that practically all the topics of the program are the
staple of what we do every day. I don't think Research  should spend 
money for this class.

Vince: 

For two decades now, I have been a member of the faculty helping to 
organize the Eastern Conferences on Regulation and Competition that Michael 
Crew of Rutgers has chaired.  This year will be, in fact, the 20th 
anniversary conference and a number of notable personages will be joining 
us to celebrate what we have learned and what we haven't about the 
economics of network industries.  Fred Kahn, Al Philipps, Bill Hogan and a 
number of other distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and 
the prospects for the future.  The conference will take place at a 
beautiful site in the Poconos, about 90 minutes north of Philadelphia, from 
Wednesday afternoon May 24th to Friday afternoon May 26th.  You can check 
for yourself the nature of the program and the conference site/hotel at the 
following website URL: 

http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~crri/WS.htm 

Michael Crew and I would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an 
after dinner speaker on Thursday evening (May 25th), just before the key 
research reviews of Friday morning take place on the electricity, telephone 
and gas industries, and following a day of special topics on emerging power 
markets and other developments in network industries.   Naturally we would 
be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference, but 
knowing your schedule, you may only have time for a part of it.  That would 
not be a problem.  The usual after-dinner address is for 30 minutes, 
followed by a short Q&A period. 

Your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of 
Enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price 
discovery and efficient risk management for market participants, in energy 
markets and more generally.  Both Michael and I feel that your perspectives 
on the ""new science of risk management"" and what can be expected from it 
could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event. 

Please let me know (and please do copy Michael on your response) whether 
your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event. 
Michael and I would, of course, be very happy to follow up with you in 
discussing the nature of the presentation, participants and so forth, if 
this is a go.  I look forward to hearing from you.

I talked with Keith Harris, our CFO at Wessex, about the RAB multiple graph I 
gave you.  He expressed that the Wessex people had originated the data and 
that the graph was correct, to the best of their knowledge.  The only (but 
very important correction) is that they started the graph at an index of 
100%, which does not imply a 100% of RAB multiple.  Rather, the initial RAB 
multiple was around 80%, implying that the entire line should be taken down 
by 20 percentile points.  Thus the all time hime in late 98 should be closer 
to the 1.3x RAB that I had targeted during our discussion.  Please call Keith

To reconfirm my conversation yesterday with Reid Grossman, a consultant hired 
by the referenced counterparty to negotiate their trading documents with us:

1.  PUD #1 would also like to get gas and power trading agreements in place 
with us.  Per my conversation with Dave Fuller yesterday, the physical 
trading agreements are of a higher priority than the financial trading 
agreement.
2.  They would like to get a draft of a collateral annex from us.  Their 
suggested trading threshold for themselves was in the $3.5-5mm range.
3.  They would already be in default of the MAC's you sent me in the credit 
worksheet dated 1/25/01.  We need to revisit the MACs.
4.  They think a 3rd party debt threshold of $1mm is too low for them, they 
suggested a threshold of $10mm.
5.  The agreement provides for annual and quarterly financial statements.  I 
don't think they have quarterly.  You need talk to them about what they 
can/will provide.

If you would like to talk to Reid directly, his ph no. is 509/252-5096.

I don't need Stokes & Bartholemew to serve as lobbyists - I need them to 
continue to serve as local counsel on a few projects we're continuing to work 
on. I've been using Johnny Hayes for lobbying matters.

Kay - do we need to do anything to keep Stokes on board as local counsel for 
our Haywood and Shelby projects?

business as soon as possible (Version 1a). I do not want to poison progress 
with my opiniion, but I think that the critical first step is to find a way 
to aggregate positions in coarse buckets, perhaps sacrificing precision for 
speed, based on ""rules"" that oerations can deliver, Research can stand behind 
and Commercial will accept.,  and using an equally coarse VAR calculation 
(the equivalent of AD-hoc VAR?) that can be delivered to the ""official books 
and records"" on a daily basis.  This I believe would be acceptable for a 2-3 
month time frame (at which time we get version1b) as opposed to waiting 2-3 
months to implement a better process and have nothing in the interim.  
Ultimately, I would look for Version 2a to be delivered and very defendable 
by 1/1/01.  This will require indulgence and compromise on all fronts but I 
cannot conceive of a better way.  Please let me know if this is consistent 
with your understanding.  A critical point from my perspective is that the MG 
commercial team and metal operations staff understand their role in making 
this happen and willingness to accept the consequences.  I look for you to 
take the lead as leader of the integration to do so.  If you need any input 
from the rest of us to underscore the importance please let us know.  As I 
alluded to on the phone, the people in Houston that have been involved in the 
VAR process have been through an extraordinary period of detailed scrutiny of 
VAR by commercial and have been hindered by the lack of basic understanding 
by all parties as their responsibilities.  Given the distance and the newness 
of the Metals personell, I fear that this could set us all up for some 
surprises and some very uncomfortable communication, much of which is not 
entirely necessary.

		 Subject: Call to Discuss Possible Options to Mitigate Effect of DWR 
Contracts--Privileged and Confidential


	


PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the 
past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's 
electricity crisis.
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small 
customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States 
Petroleum Association, and Enron.
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to 
achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in 
California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from 
the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the 
utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers 
would go to market.  
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close 
devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the 
utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January 
and today remain very contentious).
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR 
contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore 
structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the 
contracts.
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large 
customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR 
contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to 
address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) 
killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure 
focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not 
include Direct Access.
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any 
""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract 
provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the 
state are minimal or nonexistent.)
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might 
reform the contracts.
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear 
that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally 
abrogate anyone's contract rights.

We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some 
options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the 
core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM 
PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let 
me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Thanks,
Jeff

referring to several different issues here. First of all, our forward 
obligation report does not reflect cross-portfolio deals, an application 
issue that Will Smith, and it looks like Kroum as well, has been working on 
for the past few weeks. 

Also, deal 498488 is a forward deal done on EOL between STSW and their own 
desk. I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before, but I'm sure anything is 
possible. At any rate, this doesn't look like a cross-portfolio deal at all. 
Am I missing something?

As for the zeroed out deals, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows how to 
properly kill deals in Enpower; however, it takes so long that sometimes we 
simply zero out the volume in the interest of time. I've often wondered if 
this litters the system and makes it more confusing for other people to do 
their jobs - do you know anything about that?

I just thought I'd ask these questions while the subject was being raised. 
Please let me know if I can help facilitate these changes or improvements in 
any way.

      I think the report should work that way even now.

     I think I found a deal like that 498488 between EPMI Southwest and EPMI 
Southeast,
     Region R7, please take a look at that when you test the report.

       
       I saw lots of deals on the report with volume 0 and price 0, they were 
entered that way
       in Portland. There might be another reason, but I think someone wanted 
to kill the deals.
       There is an option in Deal Entry to do that, if one opens a deal and 
right click with the
       mouse on the status (Done), one can kill a deal.

The ""two sides of a cross-portfolio deal"" language is a bit vague and 
misleading. A cross-portfolio deal is kind of like a desk to desk deal. 
Another Enron book has traded with one of ours.

Two important things need to happen with cross-portfolio deals.
 1. They need to only show on the forward obligation report when ""Desk to 
Desk"" is selected.
 2. They are only financial in nature, no physical delivery is ever done 
cross portfolio.

I don't think ""both sides"" is correct. We need to only see our buy or our 
sale when we query for our point.  When the other portfolio queries their 
stuff, they should see their side.

Subject: Enron Online Japan - Tax Issues =20

I received advice today from our outside law firm in Tokyo regarding their=
=20
final conclusions on the Japanese tax issues relating to the non-Japanese=
=20
trading offices trading with Japanese counterparties. The following is a=20
summary of their advice:

A. Cash Settled Derivatives Transactions
1. Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions

Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities, standard=20
swaps, options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment=
=20
flows should not be subject to withholding tax. However, to the extent that=
=20
Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments, concern exists that imput=
ed=20
interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding ta=
x.

2. Consumption Tax (VAT) and Excise Taxes

Although Japan imposes a 5% consumption tax (VAT), financial transactions a=
re=20
generally not subject to the consumption tax, so cash settled derivative=20
transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax.  Japan=20
imposes various excise taxes, some of which apply to commodities that are t=
he=20
subject to Enron Online transactions, such as petroleum excise tax.  Such=
=20
excise taxes generally apply to physical importation and domestic sale and=
=20
delivery of covered products and should generally not apply to purely=20
financial derivatives transactions which reference commodity prices.

3. Collateral for Derivatives Transactions

If Enron entities will take collateral from Japan-based customers in=20
connection with derivative transactions, depending upon the specific=20
arrangements, withholding tax liability might arise.  For example, if an=20
Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japan-based customer and=
=20
pays interest on it, such interest payments could be subject to local=20
withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer.

B. Physically Settled Transactions
1. Consumption Tax

Japan imposes consumption tax (VAT) on the importation of tangible goods an=
d=20
on domestic transfers of tangible goods. Consumption tax should be applicab=
le=20
to imports of all physical commodities indicated at the Enron Online websit=
e,=20
including natural gas, LNG, petroleum and derivatives, coal and pulp and=20
paper.  Consequently, commodity contracts for physical settlement should=20
provide that ownership of the commodity will pass outside Japan to the=20
Japan-based customer.  As owner of the products upon import, the Japan-base=
d=20
customer would act as importer for consumption tax purposes and in that=20
capacity would handle formalities upon import, pay import consumption tax a=
nd=20
then credit or seek a refund for the resulting input consumption tax.=20

If, instead, the title to the commodities is transferred after such=20
commodities enter Japan, each Enron entity that sells to Japan would be=20
required to register as a taxpayer for consumption tax purposes, pay=20
consumption tax upon import and file consumption tax returns.  While such a=
n=20
arrangement is feasible, in practice, other industries have encountered=20
resistance from customs authorities (who administer the import consumption=
=20
tax system) to the designation of a non-resident entity as formal importer.

2. Excise Tax

Japan imposes an excise tax on the importation and transfer of various=20
commodities, including natural gas, LNG, crude oil, and refined petroleum=
=20
products.  Petrochemicals may also be subject to excise tax depending upon=
=20
the specific product. Other commodities listed at the website, including=20
coal, plastics (except if a specific product were characterized as a=20
petrochemical subject to excise tax), and pulp and paper, are not subject t=
o=20
excise tax.  Again, Enron entities should transfer ownership of commodities=
=20
before they reach Japan so that the Japan-based customer acts as importer a=
nd=20
has responsibility for payment of excise taxes.

C. Tax Representations

The trading offices considered were those located in the US, the UK,=20
Singapore, Australia, Canada, Spain and Norway. Japan has tax treaties in=
=20
force with all of these countries.  Consequently, with respect to GTCs=20
entered into with these trading offices, the tax payor and payee=20
representations may provide that:

(1) the counterparty agree and represent that withholding tax will not appl=
y=20
and will not be deducted from payments it makes to Enron entities, and
(2) with respect to payments the counterparty will receive from Enron=20
entities, it is eligible to claim relief under the business profits article=
=20
of an applicable tax treaty and does not have a permanent establishment in=
=20
the paying Enron entity=01,s jurisdiction. =20


Please let me know if you have any questions, need any additional informati=
on=20
or would like me to forward our outside advisor=01,s memo on this subject t=
o you.

Subject: Transport formula settles

Scott--
Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the 
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as 
possible.  This means using as few ""formula based"" curves as possible and as 
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible.  I'm not sure how you or 
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but 
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating 
transport p&l.  In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are 
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas.  These could 
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates.  The 
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index 
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.

Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue 
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES 
business in our portfolio, the times have changed.  Currently we are using 
""formula based"" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport 
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and 
how we are marking the curves.  For example, today's Gas Daily postings 
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY   GAS DAILY SPREAD   SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
TCO pool $2.985   $1.565     $.10
TCO citygate $4.55

CNG North $3.39   $  .585     $.16
CNG South $3.305   $  .670     $.16~
CNG Citygate $3.975

Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong.  There are 
two solutions that I see.  One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which 
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other 
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more 
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace.  That's up to you.  
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads 
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know 
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it), 
we need to focus on it being accurate.

Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work 
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

Colleen,

Mark wanted me to let you know where a few city gate points are settling 
daily:

CNG North City Gate = GD CNG North +.16
CNG South City Gate = Settles at what the intra-month trader sets their 
intra-month curve at.
TECO Citygate = GD CGT/App +.10

Please note that CNG North City and TECO City settle prices come in at a one 
day lag.  After we receive gas daily settles, we reload prices for any 
derived curves.
If you have any questions please let me know.

I don't see anything glaringly wrong in these, but I am not a corporate

(except that each member gets one vote at the ""parent"" level, section 6.5 -- 
how is balanced voting assurred there?)  Also, it takes one year to withdraw 
(section 5.7)  It seems like the timing should be shorter, perhaps, 6 
months.  ,I assume that MAPP and MAIN have hired corporate counsel to draft 
these, but JOE do we need to have one of the Enron corporate lawyers look at

Michelle -

In the meeting we had last month regarding background investigation policies, 
we discussed the area on our current application where the candidate is asked 
to disclose convictions, etc.  In some instances, the candidate could 
truthfully disclose nothing, yet have a misdemeanor conviction for theft, 
possession, etc.  or other charges that would be potential disqualifiers for 
a position with Enron.  Since the question is poorly phrased, you had 
recommended that this piece be reworded, and you suggested that Ryan Seleznov 
bring it up in the Recruiting Council.  I brought this up to Ryan, but she 
felt that this would probably be more in the province of your area or Felicia 
Acevedo.  Would you like to take this task on, or would it be more 
appropriate to ask Felicia Acevedo to work on it?

Thanks.

I just realized that this is at the same time as our GE conference call.  Can 
we adjust the time of the GE call?

I have a feeling that Roger's presentation is the generic mark-to-market 
stuff, but I could be wrong. I just don't get the feeling that it is directed 
to the lease accounting rules and other stuff specific to Turbine Torture.  
Do you have any follow up questions from last week you want me to ask?

I'm expecting a draft of the ABB facility agreement tomorrow.  A & K really 
dropped the ball on that one, although I wish I had expedited them more.  I 
still haven't heard from Kent, despite email, voice mail, and calling Lee.  I 
hope he is ok, because being non-responsive is not Kent's style at all.

Did you see that Moby Dick (aka, GE) is swallowing another big fish 
(Honeywell).  I heard it increases their size by a third.  So I guess the 800 
pound gorilla is now a 1066 pound gorilla. (ok, I admit I used the

Subject: Phone Calls w/Large Customers re: Core/Noncore Proposal

I've had several phone calls with large customer groups over the past 
24-hours, mostly explaining our noncore/core proposal (in contrast to the one 
that the Assembly Democrats have launched which would saddle business with 
100% of the utilities' past debts).  As folks know, the cost shift provision 
of the Dems plans have been erroneously attributed to us in some cases.

The business folks have been very appreciative of the discussions and have 
recognized that, generally, our proposal is a fair and reasonable one.  They 
are going to try to set up direct negotiations with Hertzberg and have 
requested that I be part of those negotiations.  They are not sure that 
Hertzberg will go along with the idea, but they're going to try.  They will 
get back to me when they find out.  I'll report back soon as I hear something.

I would like to explore how the DC Office can plug in on the advance planning 
of Ken's DC trips.  As we get things organized here I want to do a better job 
of maximizing the use of our corporate execs when they are in town.  This is 
hard to do without some advance notice of travel arrangements.  I do not want 
to be intrusive but I do think we can bring added value to Enron's presence 
in DC.  What most immediately brings this to mind is that I learned from news 
sources today that Ken is giving a speech (participating via panel) at the 
Club for Growth's event tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. in Senate Dirksen.   We 
have been busily planning all of Enron executives' trips to the inaugural and 
I thought I had something of a handle on each executive's itinerary.  So this 
came as a surprise.  A second  problem with this is that it is being hosted 
by Craig Shirley Associates.  I am told by Cynthia that Craig Shirley Assoc. 
is the group that last year hired private investigators to ferret out our 
tactics and strategies on electric restructuring.  Ken may not know this 
relationship.  Some vetting of the invite might have brought this to his 
attention.  I appreciate your thoughts on this and how I can most effectively 
add our input.  Thanks.

Back in 1997 John Echols was appointed liquidator to continue the process of 
liquidating Enron Gas Liquids Europe S.A.R.L. (which I presume is the same 
entity to which you refer).  

By copy email I'm asking John Echols, Sue Kelly and Justin Boyd what happened 
to the liquidation proceedings.  Does the entity still exist and if not, how 
can we get copies of the liquidation evidence.

		 Subject: Counterparty Name Conventions


In accordance with the suggestions provided by Mary Cook in our Legal Dept., 
we have come to an agreement in regard to the naming conventions for 
divisions and trade names. For both divisions and dba/trade names, the 
counterparty name will be formatted to lead with the sub-entity name, 
followed by the parent legal name.

 i.e. division name, division of parent legal name  or  trade name, a dba of 
parent legal name

 Ex. Duke Power, a division of Duke Energy Corporation

This layout will make it easier to choose the correct counterparty name and 
avoid the misconception of duplicate records. Also the legal requirements 
will be met.

Please notify me by Friday, June 8th, if there are any issues with this 
format. Otherwise, the GCP group will commence using this proposed layout on 
current and future requests. 

Cleanup of existing records in GCP and Contracts will be accessed. In cases 
where the requested name could exceed the 90 character length maximum there 
will need to be an evaluation.

If there are any questions, please contact me @ 3-6517.

Thank you,
Marilyn

and I did it a few days ago.  Haedicke isn't that fast either.  I don't think 
they like all this automation, but it really makes it so much quicker.  I'm 
going to be the queen at invoices and expense reports because I do so many of 
them.  I like both systems, but then I'm very adaptable.  

Did you give me an ok review?

Kay, I called Cingular to see what was up with your bill.  The last payment 
was made the end of March.  Your credit card expired March, 2001.  So, you 
are not set up currently for your credit card to be charged.  I'm going to go 
ahead and expense this charge and then you'll need to pay it.  If you want it 
set up again on your credit card, you have to send Cingular a letter stating 
your wishes.

I also changed your address to this building while I had her on the phone.

Is all of this ok with you?>

Good Afternoon Tana,

StatOil Energy has performed a deal that they would now like reassigned under 
a new counterparty name - StatOil Energy Services Inc.  I explained to Kara 
Mucha (StatOil contact) that the trades done on EOL were firm and in order to 
actually have this done, an assignment needed to be drafted by legal etc.    

I am forwarding the details on a deal performed on 3/28/00 that needs to be 
reassigned.   Bob Bowen in confirmations explained that we should perform an 
over the counter trade just exactly the opposite  to cancel out the trade and 
then perform the trade over the counter with the right counterparty name.  
However in verifying with our Product Control Group, they suggested I forward 
this information on to you.

Rick and Ted,

It looks more like foxes building chicken houses as opposed to foxes guarding 
chicken houses.

I shall send a message to Bryan saying that the Research has to look under 
the hood and examine the mechanics
of the model in order to sign off on it. A dog and pony show is not 
sufficient. In any case, the decision to approve
the model should not be left to Ben and Kirstee.

Please, let me know what your thinking is.

Vince/Steve -- we are going to the Board in December to ask for formal 
limits.  As you know one of the key limits at the Board level is Value at 
Risk. To that end, it is imperative that you are comfortable with our 
approach for calculating VaR.  We have implemented a third party risk system 
which holds all of our positions and are in the process of putting the debt 
positions in.  The system has a VaR engine which is being demo'd by the 
vendor today.  Ben and Kirstee are attending the demo and if they find the 
technology acceptable, I propose moving forward with implemantion of the 
module.  Pls. let me know if this sounds reasonable and how you would 
envision implementing.

Subject: 4Q Earnings from ENA Principal Investments

We have now refined our initial estimates for potential 4Q fair value 
earnings on each of our portfolio investments:

Dais-Analytic ($8.27 MM) - DAC has signed an agreement with Lucky Goldstar of 
Korea which includes a $5 MM minority equity investment at a pre-money 
valuation equal to $147.9 MM.  The agreement has been signed, is legally 
binding, can not be unilaterally terminated by LG and transfer of money will 
happen as soon as LG receives Korean central bank approval.  (Note:  We could 
take an additional $3.55 MM gain, or $11.8 MM aggregate, if we chose to 
exercise our option to invest $4.5 MM in DAC prior to year end)

Encorp ($14.1 MM) - Encorp has received a term sheet from Ballentine Capital 
which values the company at $100 MM pre-money.  Beacon Capital and Goldman 
Sachs have both passed on making an investment at $100 MM.  Given current 
market conditions, we believe a pre-money valuation of $90 MM is more 
realistic and closer to what Ballentine will ultimately do the deal at.  The 
$14.1 MM figure corresponds to a valuation of $90 MM.   

Solo Energy ($1.5 MM) - the downturn in the equity markets has had its effect 
on Solo's fund raising.  Chase H&Q has solicited a number of investors in the 
market, including Beacon, Perseus, Stephens (Little Rock) and Ballentine and 
all are interested and reviewing.  Charlie's sense is that the term sheets 
that we should receive by year end will be at a valuation lower than the $80 
MM that H&Q has been advertising to the company (and us).  The $1.5 MM figure 
corresponds to a pre-money valuation of $60 MM, which we view as more 
realistic.

Metering Technology Corp. ($1.0 MM) - Aqua International Partners has agreed 
to invest $15 MM at a pre-money valuation of $45 MM.  

Power Systems Mfg LLC ($0.72 MM) - the principals of PSM have agreed to sell 
the company to Calpine for $43 MM, making our warrant worth $1.72 MM.  Enron 
will receive cash for the warrant upon closing of the deal.  PSM's proceeds 
will be paid out over a 2-3 year period.

Utiliquest - we learned in November that Utiliquest had lost its bid to 
retain the Atlanta area locating business of BellSouth, Atlanta Gas & Light, 
Metromedia (Cable TV) and Georgia Power.  This was obviously disappointing to 
us - and symptomatic of the performance which led me to replace Utiliquest's 
CEO just prior to the award of Atlanta bid (which went to STS, a subsidiary 
of Dycom).  The initial indication from the company was that - while Atlanta 
represented $20 MM in revenues (roughly 20% of total revenues) - there would 
be a proportionately smaller change in EBITDA and the bottom line.  After 
further analysis - conducted in connection with our planned divestiture - we 
have determined that there will likely be a $2-3 MM reduction in EBITDA for 
2000.  Our anticipated EBITDA exit multiple is 6-7x 2000 figures.  I need to 
discuss a revaluation of Utiliquest in more detail with Kevin, Wes Colwell 
and Andrea Reed.

Total comes to $25.6 MM plus whatever we determine is achievable on 
Utiliquest. 

Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks for the email.  Congrats on the getting non-binding bid, I think.  
When we get a chance, after Sempra closes, please set up a meeting with all 
of us and Frevert to discuss in detail.  Also include Jeff Donahue. You are 
aware of my concerns and issues and we need to discuss them in great detail 
before we move forward with Pacificorp.

Subject: Pacificorp - Synfuel

Pacificorps' board has given the ok for their capital division to negotiate 
with us on an exclusive basis for the sale of the 4 - synfuel machines they 
currently own and operate in Alabama.  Pacificorp advertises that each 
machine is capable of producing synfuel at the annual rate of 1.5 - 2.0 mm 
tons,  for a total of 6 - 8 mm annual tons.  

We will meet with Pacificorp early next week in Portland to discuss a due 
diligence schedule and ground rules for the sale.  We will obviously require 
one or more qualified monetizers to work with us on this deal from day one.  
If we line up more then one monetizer it would be helpful if we appoint a 
single monetizer to be the lead, otherwise we may end up facing conflicting 
demands from each monetizer.

Our ideal structure would have the monetizers immediately owning 100% of the 
equity in the machines, while we provide the sites, coal supply, and synfuel 
sales.  We need to work with the monetizers to identify qualified operators, 
while not taking any operating risk ourselves.

Given the ""lease""  issue surrounding the Sempra deal, we need to make sure we 
structure Pacificorp (and AIG) as a mtm deal.  

We currently have a site team that has identified appropriate sites, and is 
starting the preliminary engineering and permitting work on each site.  The 
sites include river terminals and mines in West Virginia and Kentucky.

We expect to finalize Sempra this week ( 2 - machines on an accrual basis).   
""Team Synfuel"" will then focus their activities on AIG (3 - machines) and 
Pacificorp (4 - machines) in order to close at least one of the deals by the 
end of October.  Our goal remains to secure 4 - 6 machines by the end of the 
year.

I am in Houston (rrived Satruday), and will be in office on Monday (though

It looks like your team will be getting involved in some form on the DPC 
side.  I have already made a recommendation to Wade.

I am attaching a small memo that I have addressed to Wade on the DPC position 
and possible workout.  This is still a draft and will likely get shared later 
with others.  I would love to get your comments on the same.  At the same 
time, this also will give you some idea of the problem, in conjunction with 
the other Plan presentation I had sent you.

Look forward to touching base with you.

Sandeep.

I think Richard Sanders is managing this litigation.  The other party is 
Interfert.  And John, trust me, since I managed this while at ECT (nka ENA), 
you don't want to give Richard any reason to transfer it to you (or to me).  
Its a pain.  Besides, I can't imagine that this would be under EECC, but the

John - I knew that this was tickling my memory and suddenly I remembered!  
Back in 1997 John Echols was appointed liquidator to continue the process of 
liquidating Enron Gas Liquids Europe S.A.R.L. (which I presume is the same 
entity to which you refer).  

By copy email I'm asking John Echols, Sue Kelly and Justin Boyd what happened 
to the liquidation proceedings.  Does the entity still exist and if not, how 
can we get copies of the liquidation evidence.

Hi, Kate. It surely can wait that long. 

By the wasy, we have another company that somehow has been allocated to us, 
Enron Gas Liquids, a French Company, that EECC was surprised to find it owns 
and has no use for, so we would like to liquidate it as well. Is that 
something your gang would handle as well, just to make sure that no other

Subject: ABB Agreement for Review

Here are my comments:

Assignment Language:
in (i) ""WestLB"" should be changed to ""Purchaser""
in (ii) - although this is a business point I think it is important to 
question: why should we provide credit support to the JV/partnership/llc when 
we are required to keep a min. 19.5% interest?  This is not a GE requirement 
and it is a doubling up of Enron-type support which will make the venture 
much more expensive to finance.

Purchase Agreement:
Def. of Business Day:  let's add New York since this is where WestLB funds 
from.
2.1(B):  It should be ""Agent's"" person to approve change orders, not 
""Purchaser's""
2.2:  ""Purchaser"" should be used rather than ""WestLB"" since it is not as 
limiting.
7.1:  Why is the Effective Date backdated to the date of the first option 
agreement execution date?
Exhibit N - Purchase Amount Reconciliation:  The total amount of the three 
purchase amounts is $78M less than the same amounts detailed in the latest 
Option Agreement.  I'd like to understand why this is, especially in light of 
the Effective Date in 7.1, to insure that AA won't determine that the Option 
Premiums paid were somehow a deposit or credit toward the purchase price of 
the transformers.

Gentlemen,

I've made some changes to the assignment language of the ABB contract. The 
language is not identical to the LM 6000 language, but is substantially the 
same, and in some respects better.  Please let me know if you have any 
substantive comments:



I am also attaching the current draft of the contract.  It is being revised 
to incorporate delivery dates and to clarify the scope to include 
installation obligations of ABB (haul and install).  Also, in the fourth line 
of the first paragraph, the word ""Purchaser"" will be added to the 
parenthetical, after ""WestLB"". Any other changes should be very minor or 
technical.

We are trying to get this finished this week.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions or comments.

Kay

1999.
Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning to

to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are the subject of
the Central Bank regulations.  Please let me know whether or not you agree or

In order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with t=

organizational change will be effective immediately.  A new business unit,=
=20
Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS), is being formed which wi=

include our existing operations in Enron Engineering and Construction Compa=

(EE&CC), Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), and National Energy Producti=

Brian Stanley, as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Keith Dodson, =

Chief Operating Officer will provide the leadership for this new=20
organization, reporting to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale=20
Services.  NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand-alone business under=
=20
John Gillis, President.

With the majority of EE&CC and OEC=01,s activities focused on assets and=20
projects which are in Wholesale Services, this will better align the effort=
s=20
of EEOS with the commercial businesses it supports.  While EEOS will be a=
=20
stand-alone unit within Enron Wholesale Services it will work very closely=
=20
with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports.

This realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabiliti=

Engineering will have dual reporting to both EEOS and the business units=20
which they support. =20

With an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wid=

that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design,=20

At the end of the day, we need the name of the entity which will be the owner 
of the shares to set up an account at Morgan Stanley, if it is different from 
Enron Brazil Power Holdings.  Legal will need corporate paperwork to open the 
account.
Please let Theresa and I know when that determination is made.  It sounds

Once ESA LLC (a Delaware company) gets the two certificates for 1.25M each, 
Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII can be sold to Whitewing.  If there is a 
legal issue for having the ADR's held offshore we can certainly have EBPH XII 
sale to a Cayco which will have net  tax consequences similar to the 
distribution to ESA LLC.   .  I am simply trying to simplify the 
transaction.  Please let me know if they need to be transferred to a Cayco 
and I can work with legal and try to find an appropriate Cayco that may 
already be established rather than setting up a new one.

Subject: Re: Next steps with Copel shares  

Bruce Harris:

We do not need to set up a new Cayman entity to transfer the two certificates 
for 1.25M  to.  We achieve no US tax benefit for transferring or holding the 
shares in a Cayman entity.

I propose that EBPH XII obtain the two certificates and then distribute those 
certificates to Enron South America LLC, the sole shareholder of EBPH XII.  
The value of the certificates at the date of transfer will determine the US 
tax treatment.   Given the liquidity discount surrounding the stock, using 
the screen price on the date of the transaction is probably not a good 
indicator of the fair market value.  For tax purposes, we will assume the 
value to be the historical cost basis since recent trades have been in a 
narrow band on either side of that value.    If the first 1.25M certificate 
is sold shortly after the transfer to Enron South America LLC, we will need 
to adjust the transfer price since the sales price to a third party will be a 
valid indicator of what the fair market value was on the date of the 
distribution..

If the ultimate transfer price is higher than the tax basis, EBPHXII will 
recognize taxable income and pay US tax on the gain in the year the 
distribution was made to Enron South America LLC. This would result in 
reporting a tax expense in 2000 and perhaps book income in 2001 if that sale 
takes place after the end of the year.   

If the value on the date of the transfer is ultimately determined to be less 
than the historical tax basis, the distribution to Enron South America LLC 
will result in there being unrecovered basis in EBPH XII.

If the shares are sold by EBPH XII to affiliated Cayman companies, the same 
valuation issues exist with the same potential for recognition of US gain on 
the sale from EBPH XII to an affiliated.  Distributing the shares to Enron 
South America LLC will be much easier.

Robert and Kay, thanks for all your work on getting the shares moved out of 
Brazil and into the parent CayCos.  I understand that by sometime early next 
week the physical ADR certificates will be returned by BONY to the Enron 
vault.  

Here is what we now need to do:

1. We are going to need to send one certificate back to BONY and split it 
into three new certificates.  Two certificates will be for approximately 
1.25M shares each, the balance for about 5M shares.

2. We need to form a new CayCo and sell or otherwise transfer (capital 
split?) the two 1.25M tranches to this NewCo.  This needs to happen next week.

3.  Pending Dan Boyle's structuring efforts and an affirmative Corp. decision 
(supervised by Joe Kishkill), the two existing CayCos which now own the Copel 
shares will be sold into Whitewing Fund.  That means about 12.5M shares will 
go to Whitewing and the certificates will remain in the vault.  This would 
happen last week of the year--if it happens (there are actually about 
15,443,000 total ADRs--I am approximating in this email).

4. The NewCo shares will remain outside this structure entirely. We will need 
to put one tranche of 1.25M into a brokerage account--Sheila at this point we 
will bring you in for assistance (again, hopefully next week).

5. Robert--we need to work out soon with Sheila, Skadden,and BONY to 
establish an efficient mechanism to convert the full 1.25M share certificate 
to unrestricted ADRs absent and prior an immediate buyer(s)--or we need to 
figure out foolproof mechanics for constantly reissuing new certificates for 
every small sale.  We will then be looking for effective points to sell these 
1.25M shares--and again, Joe Kishkill will provide price/volume targets 
(execution via Gary Hickerson's group who has not yet been informed).  In 3 
months time, we will repeat the process for the other 1.25M tranche.  

Robert--please call me so we can determine: (a) how to set up NewCo/transfer 
shares, and (b) how to work the 1.25M ""unrestriction"" with BONY and Skadden. 


Regards,  Bruce

Director who recently has assumed responsibility for content delivery 
services, including the Blockbuster deal.

Rich is very intent on getting access to the cable platform as quickly as

addition to Blockbuster).

Scott and I prepared the attached cable open access proposal, which we gave

Murphy is less than one year old.  He said Murphy is a wire terrier cross.  I

it looks more like a Jack Russell.  You should have seen him running behind

kangaroo in him!  He must have had a rough day though because Ruthie was 
wanting to mess with him, and he snapped at her.  He's like Ric, you can only

Subject: Update - Proposed Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Rick,

You will recall Steve Kean participated in a conference call on Nov 14 with 
John Lavorato et al to discuss emergency Pool Rule changes that the Power 
Pool intended to implement in two days.  We developed a 5 point action plan 
to deal with the proposed Power Pool rule changes that would have a 
significant impact on the value of Enron's PPA investment in Alberta.    
By way of update to Steve, you may wish to brief him that: 1) It appears the 
Power Pool will not proceed with the rule change designed to exclude 
importers from setting pool price.  They will proceed with dispatch risk rule 
changes but we have given input on those too and I am optimistic that Enron 
will be able to live with these rule changes, the final wording of which we 
should see on Monday, 2) We  have set up a meeting with the Minister of 
Resource Development (you, Rob Milnthorp and I will attend) on December 11 to 
encourage the Alberta Government to stay the course, and 3) This week we will 
finalize our ""Lessons from other Jurisdictions"" document (that Steve sent me 
materials to include in) and will provide it to the Alberta Government and 
Power Pool and then follow up with them.

Subject: Update - Proposed Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

The attached memo provides an update on the status of the Power Pool's 
further consideration of the proposed rule changes.  In summary, it appears 
the Pool will not proceed with the proposal to exclude import offers from 
setting pool price but will recommend a rule that reduces ability of 
suppliers to become price takers on volumes that were originally priced too 
high to clear the merit order.  I will receive more specifics on the dispatch 
risk rule change on Monday.

Regards,

Rob

Subject: Comments on Wholesale Issues

Wood, the Assigned Commissioner in the investigation of wholesale electric 
markets, has asked for comments on the following questions by Friday, 
September 8.  We are an individual party to the case as well as a member of 
ARM and WPTF.  

This would be a good opportunity to get our version of what is wrong on the 
record.  The presentation that Tim and Mary put together for FERC will be 
helpful in answering these questions.  I will take a first cut at drafting 
response to be circulated by Tuesday of next week.  We can take liberties in 
providing responses that go beyond the question asked.

Market Structure:

Are the market conditions currently being experienced (price spikes and suppy 
shortages) inevitable under the current market structure?
Do generators and/or scheduling coordinators have market power?
Is there a need to mitigate such market power?
Which market participants or other entities are responsible for reliability 
planning?
Do California regulatory agencies have adequate jurisdiction to ensure 
reasonable prices and reliable service?
Do the structures and governance of the Cal ISO and PX adequately support the 
goals of providing reasonably priced and reliable service?

Market Rules:

Are there rules which allow or encourage unacceptable market outcomes?
What roles, if any, do underscheduling in forward markets, out of state 
transfers, uniform PX auction prices and ISO real-time and out-of-market 
purchases play in the outcomes being experienced?

Behavior of Market Participants:

What is working and not working in terms of price, reliability, information 
exchange, resource distribution, equity, service quality, and types of 
planned generation?

Carol -

Two things:

* First, I will try to email this guaranty to you again, followed with
a fax.  Apparently both failed to go through yesterday.
* Second, I did some research and it turns out that our general
partner is El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company, and Cecelia Heilmann is an
officer authorized to sign for both this entity and the L.P..  So if you
want to alter the signature block reflecting this general partner, feel free
to do so.

Please let me know later this morning if you still did not get our Guaranty.

Mark,  although I will hate to lose  Carlos and everyone here at EECC and 
NEPCO wants him to stay, in point of fact he has repaid his debt to society 
and is entitled to look at opportunites outside of EECC now. Please feel free 
to talk with him. He is discussing matters with Vicki et al now, and  she is 
aware that he will be contacting ENA (EWS?)as well.  

 As background, it was understood at the time we took Carlos on board that 
his long term career interests were not limited to our construction work, 
and, consistent with his resume, I have kept him mostly focused on our equity 
and finance related matters (including work-outs).  I do think well of 
Carlos, and certainly believe that he is a lawyer that Enron wants to keep.

Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what 
opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann 
recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since 
October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint 
venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing 
agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic 
investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston 
office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where 
I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on 
their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and 
CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP 
projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in 
Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions 
such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, 
partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your 
consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from 
vacation (my extension is 6-6127).

Enron Europe General Announcement
20/04/2000 15:41
Please respond to European IT Support/LON/ECT
To: ECT London
cc:  

Subject: VERY IMPORTANT - ""change of telephone numbers"" THIS WEEKEND !!!

As you are no doubt aware, THIS WEEKEND (22nd April 2000) the 0171 and 0181 
London dialling codes are being replaced by 0207 and 0208 respectively.   

Since our move to Enron House all external customers should have been made 
aware of the new 020 7783 telephone numbers.  
We are however still receiving calls on the old 0171 numbers.  

Please be aware that these 0171 numbers will be cease to operate on the 22 
April 2000.  

From this date, calls made to the old 0171 numbers will reach an announcement 
advising them to call Enron's new switchboard number: 020 7783 0000.

Please ensure that your external contacts are made aware of the correct 
number convention : 
020 7783 xxxx

Details of new phone and fax numbers are as follows :


Click here -->  <-- to access the Department Fax numbers details in the 
""Non-Commercial Bulletin Board"" database on ECTLON-LN2/ECT.


Click here -->  <-- to access the Personal Fax numbers (Surname A-H) details 
in the ""Non-Commercial Bulletin Board"" database on ECTLON-LN2/ECT.


Click here -->  <-- to access the Personal Fax numbers (Surname K-Z) details 
in the ""Non-Commercial Bulletin Board"" database on ECTLON-LN2/ECT.

If you access the Enron network via 'RAS', you must ensure that the RAS 
number is updated in your laptop settings.  
The old RAS number was 0171 316 6666.  This has changed to 020 7783 6666.  


From the 22 April 00 Oftel's 'big number' day you will no longer be able to 
dial 0171 and 0181 numbers.  The new 0207 and 0208 numbers must be used in 
their place.  Current users of the new code will know that at present you 
must use the new area code as well as the new number.

From the 22 April 00 you will be able to dial either the local number on it's 
own i.e. 7783 0000 or the area code and local number i.e. 020 7783 0000.


If you have any questions please contact European IT Support  on 36777

On January 14, 2000, we transacted with Conective via NatSource for a Nov '00

indicates we bought the swap.  The broker confirm indicates we sold the 
swap.  Our confirm to the counterparty was executed as Enron buying by their 
operations manager, Joseph Glace.  The counterparty is contending that the 
broker confirm is correct.  Trading contends our confirm is correct and 
binding.  How should we proceed?  The value of the position is roughly $3MM 
of revenue.

Ken Lay put a call in today to Scott McNealy.  His office called back to find 
out what specific bill included direct access.  When I called back, they put 
me in touch with Mavis Toscano, who's in Sun Microsystems' state and local 
government affairs office.  She's Scott's point person on public policy, and 
she's been working on the energy issue.  Mavis had done some checking and no 
one had heard anything about direct access.

Sun is active in three main trade associations: the Chamber, the American 
Electronics Association (AEA) and Technet.  None of those organizations said 
their members were asking for direct access, but Mavis promised to put calls 
in to them and get direct access on the radar screen.  Although she said 
they're not inclined to send letters, Mavis said she'd make some calls into 
the legislators, specifically Bowen.

Mark-

Today, we received IBJ's responsive comments to the points that have been=
=20
raised, which are set forth below for your review.

IBJ has stated ""In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral=
=20
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA.""  During our recent=20
meeting they did not deny that IBJ had entered into CSAs with financial=20
institutions.  I note that IBJ also raised the point that Enron had a loan=
=20
from IBJ of roughly US$ 100,000,000.
Jonathan Whitehead has raised this issue with John Suttle to receive his=20
input. =20

IBJ's specific responses are quoted below as follows:-

""Part 1

(a)  Agreed not include Affiliates of PartyA.

(g)  We prefer to terminate the Transactions when as a result of merger as=
=20
for a party, a surviving party of such becomes materially weaker than befor=
e.

Part 3

We usually accept to deliver a copy the list of authorized signatures only.

Part 4

(f)Even though deleting the word ""not"" in this provision, we can net the=20
payments with respect to the same Transaction.   Due to our system=20
incapability, we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or mo=
re=20
Transactions in the same currency.

(h) Agreed.

Part 5

(a)  If your suggested language is included, a Non-defaulting Party has to=
=20
continue to make payment to a Defaulting Party with no payment obligation,=
=20
which does not seem realistic.  We prefer to terminate Transactions when an=
=20
Event of Default occurs.  We do not like to include the provision which=20
releases a technical error.

(c)  Agreed.

(e)  We propose 5 business days instead.

(g)  We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a party's=20
branch offices. If our branch have a deal with Enron Japan, we will amend=
=20
this Master Agreement to include such branch as Multibranch Office.  We hea=
rd=20
that in most jurisdictions of the world,  it is not effective to set-off th=
e=20
obligations between a party and the other party's Affiliate.

(i)  Agreed to include this provision.

(j)  We do not prefer that a party could transfer its rights and obligation=
s=20
without the other party's consent to even its Affiliates. We might not get=
=20
approval of the transfer from our Credit Department or such transfer might=
=20
cause an additional payment of tax or other cost.

(k)  We will revert to you later.

(m)  Agreed.

(n)  Agreed to include this provision.

Part 6

We still prefer to include the provisions relating to the Commodity=20
Transactions in the respective Confirmations.""

I look forward to receiving your input.  I note that Jane McBride has start=
ed=20
here at Enron Japan, therefore I have copied her on this correspondence. =
=20
Looking forward to seeing you in Houston soon.

=09=09 Subject: Re: Fw: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT

 I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle (Credit) and it=
=20
looks like he's going to insist on the CSA.  We are going to talk tomorrow=
=20
and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.  While =
we=20
have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a=20
master agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.  Many=
=20
of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have=20
trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.  It would be=
=20
helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a=20
mark-up.

Following are my points responsive to their revisions:

Part 1 (a)  The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the=
=20
possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for=20
example, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy=
=20
this agreement would be in default).

(g)  This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk=
=20
to the other party.  It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a=
=20
reason to remove it.

Part 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells=
=20
out exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed ar=
e=20
not acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we=
=20
agree we will put it in the agreement.

Part 4 (f)  By deleting the word ""not"" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha=
t=20
payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne=
t=20
(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to=
=20
make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o=
ne=20
payment).  This is not acceptable.

(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E=
NA.

Part 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20
receive payments due even though technically in default under another=20
provision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other=20
possible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be=
=20
honored.

(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same=
=20
city.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n=
ot=20
impossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20

(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can no=
t=20
have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go=
=20
as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20
practice.

(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t=
o=20
multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each=
=20
IBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never=
=20
trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we=
=20
will never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like=
=20
to restrict ourselves that way.

(i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.  If=
=20
there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu=
t=20
wholesale deletion is out of the question.

(j)  As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while=
=20
maintaining flexibility within the corporate family.  Given the frequency=
=20
with which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is=
=20
important to us.

(k)  This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha=
t=20
went into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money. =
=20
We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without o=
ur=20
revision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rathe=
r=20
high rate given their status as a bankrupt.  We feel the non-default rate i=
s=20
more appropriate.

(m)  I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it=20
protects us both.

(n)  You know more about this than I.

Part 6  These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them=20
individually if they object for some articulated reason.  If these provisio=
ns=20
are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a=
=20
significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)=
=20
and we need to know now if they object to any of them.

Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.  =
I=20
hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.  I'm happy to discus=
s=20
any of these issues at greater length if you want.  It sounds to me like=20
IBJ's expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given th=
e=20
volume and nature of their comments.

Dear Mr.Viverito

Attached Word file is ISDA draft amended by our legal desk.
(please take the amended points as our comment on your draft)
Please check it all and kindly reply ASAP.
(CSA is not acceptable as I mentioned you before, and we'll check your
LETTER OF CREDIT after
the schedule is almost agreed)

In your draft, we cannot understand the meaning of ""EDGAR"" on page4,
so please show us what it is.

We are very hoping to conclude this process rapidly.
So, I very much appreciate it if you could send back your comment before
Holiday in U.S.(4th Sep)
(it's ok if only the rough prospects of concluding ISDA)

Best regards,

FYI...

Jeff Shankman and Fred Lagrasta are trying to change Enron's Tape Retention 
Policy from four months to forever on a number of individuals in their 
group.  Due to the inner workings of our recording system, selective tape 
retention is impossible.  It is a all or none type of situation.  Please 
review this email and our current Tape Retention Policy and decide what 
course of action is needed.  As you know this email is not enough to 
permanently stop the company's retention policy.  A new policy would need to 
be drafted and signed by John Lavorato and yourself before this could occur.

If you have any questions, please call me at 853-4764

Regards,
Darren Adamik

Subject: Frazier

On July 2, 1999 I sent counsel for the Plaintiffs a letter wherein I again 
urged them to dismiss Enron Products Pipeline from the captioned litigation.  
I received a telephone call this afternoon from David Carlile.  Mr. Carlile 
advised that he will dismiss EPP from this litigation.  Mr. Carlile then 
advised that Enron Gas Liquids, Inc. sold a large quantity of propane to the 
facility and in the event that a settlement was not reached he would bring 
EGLI into the litigation. As the conversation went along, Mr. Carlile stated 
that propane is not his target defendant and that he would settle with us for 
$50.00 per plaintiff.  He then said that his bottom line is $30,000 which is 
the lowest sum he has taken from any of the settling parties. I advised David 
that I would relay the conversation to my clients and would get back with him 
in due course.

In the interim, David is going to send me a letter along with a Non-Suit as 
to EPP.

I would appreciate your thoughts on whether we should accept the settlement 
offer.

of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

Steve: I understand that you are considering a $3,500 Enron PAC contribution 
to Congresswoman Shiela Jackson Lee. Chris and Citigroup co-hosted an event 
for Shiela last August in Washington which raised $17,000. Additionally, 
Enron PAC contributed $1,500 for her primary race (she had no race) and 
$1,000 for the general election. Her opposition is nominal. We have also 
handled various personal requests for her such as tickets to Enron Field. 

She has been helpful on several issues this year such as H1-B Visa and was in 
India with President Clinton at which she spoke to the Power Minister in a 
helpful way. Ken Lay and others jawboned her to get her vote in favor of PNTR 
for China although I think she was bargaining with everyone as she frequently 
does. Chris Long has developed a good relationship with Shiela but she seldom 
seeks us out and I think her ""delayed"" position on PNTR for China was 
unbecoming a representative from Houston. Houston will gain from PNTR for 
China. 

I would recommend a maximum of $2,000 to go along with our recommendation 
that she be more attentive to our positions on leading issues.

I don't know.   Steve never did call that afternoon to discuss the leadership 
issue.  (My comment to him will be that I would welcome him stepping into a 
leadership role on these issues, but that he needs to step up to the plate.  
This means being able to do Hill meetings on his own, being willing to step 
back and re-evaluate our strategies from time to time, and looking beyond 
Scott for policy and technical guidance).

I'm also planning to make some general comments to the group as a whole at 
our EBS GA meeting in Colorado next week.  I think I need to talk about 
individual versus group efforts.  The issues circling in my mind at the 
moment are:

People need to realize that individual success does not happen independently 
of the success of our group as a whole.
This means that every person in our group needs to be able and willing to 
work constructively will every other individual in our group.  No exceptions.
Decisions about who attends meetings, whether with the FCC, Congressional 
members and staff, or EBS executives will be determined according to  the 
nature and purpose of the meeting.  That means that sometimes I step aside 
for you or Linda or Steve Kean, and that sometimes one person in my group 
steps aside for another.  Individual success in not measured by the meetings 
that you attend.  It's measured by our effectiveness in achieving our agenda.
 Anything else you can suggest that will help make clear to people that they 
are focusing on the wrong issues and that this will have a serious negative 
impact on their performance reviews.

I really would like to get beyond this point as quickly as possible.  Please 
let me know if you ever think I'm wasting too much of your time with these 
petty issues.

How's London?  Wayne and Zal have had a series of travel complications, so 
I'm the only one in Argentina so far.  I had a very good day of meetings with 
our lawyer yesterday.  We've rescheduled meetings with the Argentine 
regulators for Wednesday afternoon, so that Wayne and Zal will be able to 
make them.  This means only one day in Sao Paolo and one day in Brasilia, but 
from all that  I've heard that's not a bad thing.

Talk to you soon.

Hi Steve,

The reason that I've used ""DC Office"" is that Linda has indicated that she 
wants to distinguish between your assignments and Allison's assignments.  I'm 
not sure if she's done this yet and I didn't want to presume anything.  If it 
works better to list your names individually I am happy to do that.  To be 
honest, though, I don't think Rick would be likely to interpret this to mean 
that your role is simply administrative.

Are you around at the end of the day today?  I have a meeting from 2:00-4:00, 
but maybe we could talk afterward about the other issues you raise.  Thanks,

Sue

Hi Sue:

This may be a function of the Washington office/EBS Government Affairs 
differing reporting relationships, but...

With the ""DC office"" appearing only in supporting roles on reports like 
these, Rick and Steve Kean are going to continue to have the impression that 
we exist to schedule meetings and execute plans formulated by others.  You 
know this is a sensitive point for me personally, but beyond that, it is 
important to my career development that I be seen as taking more of a lead.  
I suppose Allison would feel the same way once she becomes more comfortable 
and familiar with the issues.

Therefore, two requests.  

Would you consider listing Allison and me as individuals, not as ""DC Office""?

Also -- and here I may be pushing it --  as you and I have discussed a couple 
of times, am I taking the lead in the cable issue?  What about the BLM 
issue?  I always appear to Rick and Steve to be supporting Scott on these 
initiatives.  In my own twisted mind, I think of myself as having more of a 
leadership role.

Sorry to continue to be ultra sensitive about this.  But frankly (just 
between the two of us, please) since we've just brought on 2 new Senior 
Directors in the past month (knocking me a couple of rungs down the seniority 
ladder in one fell swoop), I am trying to increase my visibility ... and 
maybe claim a little more credit for issues that I have before.

Happy as always to discuss.

Muchas gracias,
Steve

As we discussed today, I am sending you this preliminary list of the Calme 
employees.  I will also fax a copy to your attention at the Drake Hotel.

We still have some work in progress on the allocations of certain people.

Upon your return we can begin to review the individuals on the list.

The enclosed list indicates the current proposed ""New Roles"" for each of the 
Calme employees.  As mentioned on the phone, we've allocated the employees 
among:  

Deploy immediately (however, certain individuals will have residual jobs to 
complete)
Transition Team (TT) to carry out the deployments and asset disposals
LNG/Middle East to go to EGM
Southern Cone (SC) (for Venezuela and Colombia businesses)
EES (which primarily include our development engineers and certain 
technical/operations people)

The table also indicates the Calme senior people (Resp Pty) assigned to 
ensure that no individual falls through the cracks.

The column ""Calme"" merely indicates our current internal sub-groupings, and 
you may wish to ignore it.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Mark, Taffy said you're under the weather. Hope you're feeling better by the 
time you open this. The attached draft is revised slightly from the one I 
previously sent to you for review. The changes are nonsubstantive from your 
standpoint - -  most of them were made to clarify that there will be 
offerings from the pipelines other than open seasons. In making the changes, 
I forgot to do a redlined draft for you, so I am faxing to you a copy 
redlined by hand. 

Thanks again for all your help.

John,

Terrell Benke was a summer Associate from the University of Chicago who has 
just accepted Enron's full-time employment offer.  Erik, her husband, 
currently works at Goldman Sachs as a junior trader in Chicago.  Therefore, 
since Terrell will be moving to Houston, Erik is very interested in pursuing 
potential trading opportunities at Enron.

Please look at his resume and inform me if you have any interest in his 
background.

Subject: Various Discussion Points

I will commit to writing the three items that I had hoped to discuss with you 
today.  Feel free to get back with me via voice mail (x35926).  If you would 
prefer to discuss any of these with me, you can reach me at home from 
December 20-23 while I am on vacation.  My home number is 281-370-8568.  I 
will be back at work for the week between Christmas and New Years. 

1)  January 1:  Do you want me to call you that day after we have tested all 
systems to give you a status update?  I can leave a voice mail for you at 
your Enron number.  Or if you prefer, I would be happy to call you if you 
will provide me with a number where you will be.  Cliff Baxter and several 
key commercial personnel have asked that I call them after we have completed 
our testing of all systems that support each commodity and product that we 
trade in North America.  I will make these phone calls myself, and will 
naturally treat all phone numbers that I have been given as confidential.  
Please let me know your preference for notification.  

2)  Definition of a global focus for trading operations:  Attached is a draft 
memo that Rick Causey proposes to send.  This memo describes a coordination 
role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that 
should be coordinated in all trading locations.  Please let me and/or Rick 
know if you have any comments or suggestions.  I had hoped to briefly discuss 
this with you in person, as I would want you to understand two points:  (1) 
This role will not prevent me from continuing a very strong focus on the 
needs of ENA.  I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy, control 
and service in ENA operations.  Through that hard work, I believe that I have 
your confidence in my ability to deliver results.  I  would do nothing to 
jeopardize that.  (2)  There is a need for this coordination function, and 
some one will play that role.  If I play that role, I can be in the best 
position to influence outcomes with ENA's needs in mind.    



3)   Gas Logistics:  I will talk with Whalley about my thoughts on this, but 
I had wanted to make you aware that Jeff Shankman believes that he wants 
logistics to report to him.  His stated reason to me is that he wants it to 
""look like power"".  I had wanted to discuss with you your thoughts on what  
the criteria should be on which we make that decision.  I will propose to 
Greg and Jeff that gas logistics should be located in direct proximity to the 
regional traders in order to facilitate the flow of commercially viable 
information about the pipes and capacity.  ( We have that now for the Central 
and West desks, and should be able to make this happen as the 32nd floor is 
built out for gas.)  I believe, however, that gas logistics should now report 
to Brent Price, my business controller over gas for the East, Central and 
West regions.  Brent would then have operations truly front to back (risk, 
confirmations, scheduling and invoicing) and he sits on 31 and works very 
closely with Jeff.   Also, Brent would be in the best position to ensure that 
the logistics team meets requirements for timeliness and accuracy of 
volumetric information so that we can achieve our target headcount reduction 
in gas operations of 52 by year end 2000.  Without a continuing focus in 
logistics on the downstream information needs, I will be concerned about our 
ability to deliver our projected cost savings.  I also believe that Brent 
will be in the best position to ensure minimal flash to actual variances.  
While Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 1996 when we had an 
earnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that 
either one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong 
front to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding 
logistics accountable for their part in this.  

I will let you know the outcome of my conversations with Greg and Jeff on 
this issue.

December 4, 2000.  Although the facts are still being developed, this 
customer was also being supplied off of the A-S line and when it went down, 
HPL had to activate another pipeline to serve this customer from a different 
source or direction.  This line may have had some liquids settled in the line 
or other sediments which became dislodged and ultimately may have caused a 
failure at Ameripol's boiler.  This resulted in a fire which they claim 
caused equipment and product damages.  Liquids are not identified in the 
quality specifications for the gas to be delivered to Ameripol, only not more 
than 20 grains of sulfur or 7 pounds of water vapor.
Additionally, the contract does contain a waiver of consequential damages.  
Gary indicated to me that they told him that about $130,000 of the loss was a 
result of lost sales due to the inability to produce product.  They have 
faxed us a written demand or notification which I will forward as soon as I 
receive it.

PG&E Gen is most interested in Pastoria and had several questions/concerns
that they asked about during my discussion with them:

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.
* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?
* They also questioned whether there would be any ""agricultural
restrictions""?

Three Mid-Columbia futures trades were executed by Matt Motley, Long Term

Trades pulled into Tagg IQ Reports -
 All three pull into Future Daily Transaction Report (RSX0245F.IQR)

 All three pull into Tagg Exchange Capture search - transaction IDs are

 All three pulled into Tagg Metacalc (Meta ID 77771 - Post ID 1035917 - Post

Because today is the Nymex Electricity Futures exercise date, we need to know 
as soon as possible for our calculations whether or not these deals are in 
the system, and if not, where they went. My confusion lies in the fact that I 
can find these deals when I do a search in Tagg for any futures deals traded 
at the Mid-C settlement index, and yet the Risk group can no longer see 
anything for Mid-C in their calculation. Please let me know what you find.

		 Subject: FERC/SEC Update

As you all may know, we have scheduled a conference call for the group for 
Thursday, Oct. 19.  Bernadette called each of your assistants, so it should 
be on your calendars.

As a brief update prior to our call:

We have a phone call in to FERC to check on the procedural status of the 
merger.  Donna Fulton, my colleague in Washington, has many contacts at FERC 
and is working with those people to learn what she can about the status of 
our proceeding.  

Joanne is supposed to be meeting with Bob Wasson at the SEC (along with Bill 
Weedon) early next week to get a sense of where the SEC is on the case.

Per Rick's suggestion, I have asked another colleague of mine in Washington, 
Chris Long, to help us decide who would be the appropriate person to make 
contact at the SEC if we decide to make that contact.  Chris is working with 
some political operatives on this.

We have been working with Portland General and Sierra on their RTO filing.  
As you may recall, a commitment to join an RTO (Regional Transmission 
Organization) is one of the things FERC will require of the merging parties.  
An RTO filing will be made at FERC on October 23.  While RTO progress has 
been good so far, Sierra and PGE have indicated that they may have concerns 
with the RTO they are working with (the Northwest RTO).  We are working with 
Sierra and PGE to make sure that they do not do anything in the RTO 
proceeding that could cause concern for FERC regarding the companies' 
commitment to join an RTO.

There was some question about the status of a temporary services company 
being created by the merged company.  Joanne has been working with the Sierra 
and PGE people on this issue and does not see this as being a problem now, 
but I have asked her for confirmation that this ""alternative"" type of service 
company arrangement will not delay the SEC proceeding.  I am waiting for a 
response from Joanne.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  

Sarah

assessed.  The Cove Point LNG, Limited Partnership and Egan Hub Partners, 
L.P. are both FERC regulated entities and both agreements have negotiated 
rates.
The Cove Point deal has a negotiated reservation charge and the Egan Hub 
Partners has a negotiated storage reservation and injection charge.  Since we 
are buying the assets of Columbia and assigning the contracts to Enron and  
these deals are at less than max rates, they would be subject to reposting 
upon assignment and there would be no guarantee that Enron would receive 
these rates in a competetive bidding situation.  It is my understanding the 
discounts were taken into account for valuation purposes, however these 
discounts are at risk due to posting requirements. 

The remainder of the storage contracts would require consents to assign.

Note: Any transport contracts with discounted rates would be subject to the 
same as above.

I am verifying the reposting requirements with Randy Rich of Bracewell &

Received a call this afternoon from Gordon Smith, CEO of PG&E (I met Gordon

Subject: Actions on Anjam's resignation

All

My preferred approach to dealing with Anjam's departure is given below.  
These recommendations are informed by the fact that I don't feel Anjam has 
much to offer his next employer, except what code and data he can remove from 
Enron:

HR-type stuff:
1. Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for 
him to remain on the floor.
2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know

IT-type stuff:
1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the 
group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more 
than a day or two.
2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjam's h: drive for weekly intervals 
over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has 
deleted.
3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjam's Notes folders, and provide records 
of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  I'm worried 
about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out.
4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from 
Anjam's c: drives.  There may be useful info here too.

As we initiate the process to certify the Wheatland and Wilton Center plants 
as control areas in ECAR and MAIN, respectively, it is necessary to create a 
special purpose corporation.  As you may recall, we formed Enron-SE Corp. as 
the control area company for the Southeast peakers, and EPMI entered into an 
agreement with Enron-SE Corp. for control area services.

I would like to create a new company named Enron-MW Corp.  Enron-MW Corp. 
would be the entity where the ECAR and MAIN control areas would reside.  
Please proceed immediately to create this new corporation.

In addition to ordering letterhead for Enron-SE Corp., please also order

I recently faxed you a power of attorney for execution on behalf of Enron 
North America Corp. - however the meeting is now to be on 11 Dec to take 
place after a change in Italian law (so resolutions can be approved by notary 
only and don't need to go to court).

As the dates have changed can you arrange for execution of this power of

Sorry for the inconvenience - if you need an initialled copy please let me

Mark -

Attached is the EGA Legal report for February.  I'm interested in your 
feedback on level of detail.  Some of our contributors gave quite a bit of 
detail (e.g., India) while others were quite a bit more brief (although 
generally on less important projects).

Also, I've left out discussion of the South America assets.  I'm assuming 
that is coming from John/Randy -- I know that Miguel Mendoza is inputting to 
them on most of these assets.

As you may have heard, Governor Davis intends to hold a press conference 
Thursday evening at 6:05 PST to deliver ""an important live address on energy 
... will speak in detail about California's energy emergency and make an 
important announcement."" ?He has requested five minutes during evening 
newscasts to make his remarks. 

While there is no way to know specifics, we've heard rumor that his remarks 
will include the following:

1. Discussion of rate increases
2. State's conservation efforts
3. Blame FERC for crisis
4. Point out what a great job he is doing 

IEP is prepared to react immediately to the Governor's remarks if needed. ?

Below are two Dow Jones stories on the press conference, and a memo that was 
released by Davis' top financial adviser, Joe Fichera.

We'll keep you posted -- but please alert me or Katie if you hear anything.

Thanks,
Jean

Calif Gov To Make 'Important' Energy Announcement Thurs  ????
Updated: Wednesday, April 4, 2001 08:17 AM?ET ????
?
(This article was originally published Wednesday) 

By Jason Leopold 

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--In a highly unusual move, California Gov. Gray Davis 
Tuesday requested radio and television stations in the state to clear five 
minutes of time Thursday evening so he can make an important announcement 
regarding the state's energy crisis. 

Davis is expected to deliver a speech at 6:05 p.m. PST and will likely talk 
about the state's conservation efforts, a 4,000 megawatt shortfall expected 
next month, the need to bring new generation online, recent rate hikes 
ordered by the California Public Utilities Commission, and the possibility 
for further rate increases this summer to keep the state's three 
investor-owned utilities solvent, sources close to Davis told Dow Jones 
Newswires. 


The source said Davis is not expected to discuss a final agreement to buy the 
power lines owned by PG&E Corp. (PCG, news, msgs), unit Pacific Gas & 
Electric, Edison International's (EIX, news, msgs) unit, Southern California 
Edison, and Sempra Energy's (SRE, news, msgs) unit, San Diego Gas & Electric. 

Davis' press secretary, Steve Maviglio, would not comment on Davis' speech. 

In a memo to the media, Davis' office said the governor will ""deliver an 
important live address on energy from his office in Sacramento. During this 
historic address to the people of California, the governor will speak in 
detail about California's energy emergency and make an important 
announcement."" 

The last time a California governor interrupted a broadcast schedules was in 
1992, when Republican Gov. Pete Wilson delivered a speech about the state's 
budget problems, a spokesman in Davis' office said. 

But Davis' staff said ""this is the first time in recent memory that a 
Governor has asked for time statewide to deliver a live address to the people 
of California.""

Calif Gov Staff To Speak To Analysts About Energy Crisis ?? ??
Updated: Wednesday, April 4, 2001 05:37 PM?ET ???
?
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Gov. Gray Davis' advisers will speak to 
Wall Street analysts Thursday following a live state address on the state's 
energy crisis, according to an email sent to the financial community and 
obtained by Dow Jones Newswires. 

Daivs' staff, in a highly unusual move, asked radio and television 
broadcasters to clear five minutes of air time Thursday night so Davis can 
make an ""important announcement"" about the state's months-long energy crisis. 

Sources close to the governor said Davis will discuss the state's 
conservation efforts, a 4,000 megawatt supply shortfall expected this summer, 
recent rate increases ordered by state regulators and the possibility for 
further rate increases to replenish the state's budget surplus. 

Davis is expected to discuss plans for keeping the state's three 
investor-owned utilities, PG&E Corp. (PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & 
Electric, Edison International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California 
Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric, 
solvent but he isn't expected to discuss a proposal to buy the utilities' 
power lines. 

Davis spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said he couldn't comment on the governor's 
speech. He said, however, Davis has received the financial data regarding the 
state's spending on wholesale electricity and what it expects to spend in the 
months ahead. 

In the email sent to Wall Street analysts, Davis' top financial adviser, Joe 
Fichera, said the governor's advisers will hold a conference call at 9:45 
p.m. EDT (0145 GMT) with analysts followed by a question-and-answer session. 

Regarding Davis' speech Thursday, Fichera wrote in his email that ""while 
everyone will wish to speculate on what (Davis) will or will not say, I can 
point out that the governor has been consistent in his goals to achieve: 
significant demand side management, increased generation supply and 
restoration of the financial health of the investor-owned utilities. 

""All three components are important elements to resolving the energy 
situation in California and will be addressed by the governor,"" Fichera wrote 
in the email. 

In addition, ""it may go without saying, but the situation in California 
involves many moving parts, many constituencies and independent players that 
need to be brought together to resolve a problem that is of a size and scope 
that no one anticipated,"" Fichera's email says. 

""It certainly appears confusing and chaotic. The governor and his team 
recognize the complexity of the problem and are rigorously attempting to move 
the process to closure,"" the email says. ""He is addressing all open issues so 
that consumers, investors and others can achieve some certainty and move on. 
We cannot make all the moving parts stop, nevertheless, the governor will 
provide the leadership needed for a resolution.""

Subject: NTSB Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board recently divulged a highly secret
plan they had funded with the U.S. auto makers for the past five-years. The
NTSB covertly funded a project whereby the auto makers were installing
black boxes in four wheel drive pick-up trucks in an effort to determine, in
fatal accidents, the circumstances in the last 15 seconds before the crash.

They were surprised to find in 49 of the 50 states the last words of
drivers in 61.2% of fatal crashes were, ""Oh, Sh*t!"" Only the state of Texas 
was
different, where 89.3% of the final words were, ""Hey Y'all, watch this!""

Kay,

What are your feeling about Montana Power's counter?  My comment would be to 
add a clause saying that MPC would have x (5?) many days to respond to ENA 
once notified that the turbine is again available for sale.

Chris

4.   If during the Term, MPC determines it does not desire to proceed with
the purchase of the Turbine, MPC shall promptly notify ENA in writing, and
this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of the date of
ENA's receipt of such notice or the expiration of the Term, without any
further liability of either Party to the other hereunder.  If, during the
Term, ENA determines in good faith that it is unable to negotiate for the
sale of the Turbine due to circumstances relating to the generator, it shall
notify MPC and refund the Consideration; provided, however, that if ENA
offers the Turbine for sale within 14 days of the termination in connection 
with the foregoing, then MPC shall be entitled to an additional exclusivity 
period of 10  business days to negotiate a definitive agreement in accordance 
with the terms of this agreement. (or something like that)

Hi Theresa,

I'm not sure if Steve Thome mentioned this to you, but Enron is opening an 
escrow account in connection with a transaction with Delta Power.  He 
suggested that I forward the wiring instructions for the payment of the 
escrow fee of $10,500.  Please let me know what other info you need to tee 
this up.

Thanks,

The CFO of Power Systems Manufacturing is  Wayne Garrett.

John Howton is forwarding your e:mail to Wayne's attention to review and 
answer questions.  Wayne and I both feel that this is a clean transfer of 
employees.  The story is as follows:

1.  They are payroll by ADP in Fort Lauderdale.  The representative is Sonia 
Vassell (954) 717-6975.  The code that they are currently using is PXU for 
processing payroll.  These employees are paid bi-weekly.

2.   Benefits = Health, Dental and Life in which Wayne does not have a 
problem with continuing to pay their benefits until the end of the year.  
This will allow us approximately 1 1/2 months to set the AMPS company up 
(effective 1/1/2001).

3.  Vacation is 15 days which include sick and vacation.  Wayne company will 
pay any accrued vacation given us a chance to determine how we want to 
structure vacation effective 1/1/2001.

4. 401K is administered by Fidelity.  There is not a company match.  So, we 
can figure out how  to handle 401k going forward.

5.  Disburse Power is the holding company that Wayne has set up to hold these 
employees until AMPS is established.

I asked John Howton who is responsible for getting the joint venture company 
""AMPS"" set up and he will call me back with that answer.  Maybe you know the 
answer.

It seems to me that this is a clean set up.  We need to determine how we want 
to process their payroll, how to handle benefits and which policies we want 
to put in place for these employees.  John has a spreadsheet with employee 
information that he will forward to our attention. 

I know you will have more detailed questions and we will need to funnel 
everything through John Howton.

Let's schedule a time to discuss in more detail tomorrow.

jeff.blumenthal@enron.com,mary.cook@enron.com,Jeff Blumenthal,Mary Cook,\Tanya_Jones_June2001\Notes Folders\Notes inbox,"Jeff, thanks for your work on Bob's draft, however, for form management 
purposes we are going to continue with our previous style which is to include 
the crossborder annexes. 

1.  Attached below is the ENA/US Annex A, which is the base GTC type of 
document that we utilize with our confirmations when we do not have an ISDA 
in place (definitions of parties are in the Confirmation).  If ENA contracts 
with a Canadian party we use the Canadian Annex attachment (also attached 
below) to the Confirmation and Annex A.  Where ENA contracts with a foreign 
counterparty other than Canada, the Canadian Annex may be utilized with 
additional legal scrubbing concerning the particular jurisdiction.  It is for 
this reason that I think we should continue the more amplified approach 
rather than targeting it toward just Canada/US.




2.  Attached below is the ECC/Canadian Annex A, which is the base GTC type of 
document that we utilize with our confirmations when we do not have an ISDA 
in place (definitions of parties are in the Confirmation).  If ECC contracts 
with a US party we use the United States Annex attachment (also attached 
below) to the Confirmation and Annex A.  Where ECC contracts with a foreign 
counterparty other than US, the United States Annex may be utilized with 
additional legal scrubbing concerning the particular jurisdiction.  It is for 
this reason that I think we should continue the more amplified approach 
rather than targeting it toward just Canada/US.




At your convenience, please review the Canadian and United States annexes and 
advise of any comments.  Thanks again.

Note to Paralegals:  Please note that the annexes are now under current 
forms.  If you have any questions about how they are to be utilized, please 
stop by to discuss.

Subject: Organizational Announcement

We are pleased to announce organizational changes to the Enron South America 
legal department in response to the recent reorganization and realignment of 
the principal Enron Wholesale Services business units operating in the 
region, Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets. 

Randy Young, currently General Counsel of ESA, will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron.  John Novak will become General Counsel of 
ESA, reporting to Mark Haedicke.  The ESA legal department will be 
responsible for supporting all Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets 
businesses in the region.  Additional legal resources, coordinated by Lance 
Schuler, will be provided from EWS Legal in Houston to support ESA's 
wholesale activities.  John will also work closely with Bruce Lundstrom, 
General Counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect to the EGA 
businesses in the region.  An organizational chart describing the new 
structure is attached.

This new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality legal 
support across business lines within South America while improving 
coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's 
existing operating businesses, as well as the new business development 
initiatives under way in the region.

I spoke with John about this.  I think in the Master Physical language we 
need to do 2 things to the existing language:

1. Clarify that the exposure that is being subtracted from $50M is ENA's 
Exposure.  The defined term in the ISDA is ""Exposure"".

2. Clarify that Counterparty's threshold is zero if as a result of 
subtracting ENA's Exposure from $50M you get a negative number.

We will go ahead and draft the multi-product guaranty and copy you on the 
draft that we send out.

Carol,  

Sorry for the confusion.

1) Yes - the guaranty should cover both contracts - $75MM to cover the 
aggregate $50MM threshold.
2)  I spoke with Jeff Hodge on whether or not this would work prior to 
sending worksheets to you guys.  The idea is that there is a $50MM aggregate 
threshold for the counterparty.  The ISDA will be a normal ISDA - with a 
$50MM threshold.  The Master Physical will be the document that needs to be 
customized to the new concept.  The Master Physical threshold language is to 
simply read that there is a $50MM threshold less any exposure under the ISDA 
collateral threshold.  I understood that Stacy or Jeff would adapt the Master 
Physical to address any legal language differences in the contracts  - i.e. 
""Exposure"", ""Termination Amounts"" etc.   Your team needs only to provide the 
ISDA to Stacy Dickson's group, and I believe they will draft the Master 
Physical to their comfort level.  

Please call me to confirm whether or not you need anything else on this  - 
and whether or not you think it can go out today.  

Thanks,

John

Brad and John:
We have not sent out the ISDA draft on energen because I need calrification 
on the following points:

1. Is the $75MM Guaranty cap meant to cover both physical and financial 
combined or are we doing separate Guarantys each with a $75MM cap amount?

2. How does the $50MM collateral threshold work?  I noticed in the physical 
master that it appears as if we subtract from the $50MM threshold our 
exposure under the ISDA to arrive at the Counterparty's threshold, although 
the language in the physical says ""the exposure"" and it is not clear whose 
exposure they are talking about.  Is that how it is suppposed to work?

The attached file is a draft of an asset management agreement prepared by Stu

Adding to the risk of summertime blackouts, the state water department said=

Thursday it might not pay ""ridiculous"" prices for electricity even if that=

leaves California short of power.=20
The Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for th=

state's two beleaguered utilities since mid-January, wouldn't spell out wha=

Gov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: ""We will continue to keep th=

The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern=

purchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it's had to relax tha=
t=20
stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Har=
t=20
said.=20
That April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell=20
electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System=20
Operator, which manages the state's power grid. Because the ISO -- which ge=
ts=20
its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water=20

=20
""If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there's a policy call to be=

The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling=

ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid.=20
""On a daily basis we're dealt a set of cards,"" said ISO spokesman Patrick=

Hart's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis an=
d=20
PG&E over the water department's power expenditures. State spending shot up=
=20
following PG&E's April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection.=20
Davis said generators began demanding a ""credit penalty"" from the water=20
department because of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the=20
state's daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million i=
n=20
the week before PG&E went bankrupt, the governor's office said.=20
Hart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. ""Every time=20
there's a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&E bankruptcy or a staged=

But prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt ho=
ur=20
April 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below=
=20
what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax new=
s=20

PG&E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state'=
s=20
increased spending.=20
""This claim is simply not accurate,"" the utility said in a memo to reporter=
s.=20
Rather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water=20
department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC orde=
r,=20
PG&E said.=20
Regardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department cou=
ld=20
further strain the state's budget -- and complicate Davis' plan to finance=
=20
the power purchases through a bond offering.=20
The state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power=20
purchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&E's=20
bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third=
=20
Wall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a ""ratings=
=20
watch"" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded.=20
A downgrade could raise California's borrowing costs. All three of the=20
leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch.=
=20
Meanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an=20
investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy=

SAN FRANCISCO =01) Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from=

These alternative generators =01) known in the industry as ""qualifying=20

Southern California Edison.=20
Some QFs say the unpaid bills have forced them to defer much-needed=20
maintenance, leading to more equipment breakdowns that reduce electricity=
=20
output. Other QFs say they simply can't afford to keep operating.=20
The PUC is worried some QFs are trying to take advantage of the California=

crisis to get out of long-term contracts that require them to sell=20
electricity at prices far below the current market rate. Several QFs are=20
suing to get out of those contracts so they can cash in on the open market,=
=20
said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood.=20
All the QFs want is to be paid for bills that date back as far as November,=
=20

which consists of 10 alternative power producers owed a combined $410=20
million. Those 10 generators produce about 3,000 megawatts =01) which Raudy=

was enough electricity for 3 million homes.=20
""We are outraged (by the PUC's investigation),"" Raudy said. ""We have heard =
so=20
much rhetoric over the past five months and still haven't been paid a dime.=
=20
That is what we are worried about.""=20
Raudy estimated his group is operating at about 95 percent of capacity.=20
After the temporary closure of several QFs contributed to rolling blackouts=
=20
around the state last month, the PUC ordered PG&E and SoCal Edison to begin=
=20
paying the generators for the energy purchased since March 27.=20
But the order has done nothing to help the QFs recover the past debts. The=

QFs are now in line in bankruptcy court with 30,000 creditors owed money by=
=20
PG&E, which expects its unpaid bills to rise to $5.5 billion by the end of=

If the QFs get desperate enough, they may decide to push SoCal Edison into =

during Thursday's hearing.=20
""Any QFs that are not operating right now are doing so for financial reason=

California will need all the power that it can get from the QFs this summer=

when rolling blackouts threaten to become a daily occurrence.=20
Combined, the QFs account for about one-fourth of California's total power=

capacity, according to the PUC.=20
The QF output will become even more essential this summer because Californi=

ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There=
=20
has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has n=
o=20
political motive to help the state.
?????""We Democrats,"" said Sherman, ""hope very much that our skepticism is=

proven wrong.""
?????Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and th=
e=20
governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he=
=20
used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by=20
Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch i=
n.=20
Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.
?????Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet wi=
th=20
Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and=20
editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick=
=20
Cheney in which, she said, he ""ignored"" her appeal for federal assistance.=
=20
?????Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, sayi=
ng=20
they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to ru=
n=20
up prices.
?????The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday befo=
re=20
an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had=20
manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline=
=20
capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it.
?????That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to=20
deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipeline=
s=20
and causing a surge in prices.
?????The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas=
=20
soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity=20
increased production last year in response to the energy crisis.
?????""We're not withholding capacity--no one is,"" said El Paso Merchant=20
Energy President Ralph Eads. ""With these prices, you want to sell every=20
molecule.""
?????In other developments Thursday:
?????* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its=
=20
ailing utility arm to financial health is in ""deep trouble and could be=20
rejected by legislators,"" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said i=
n=20
a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the=
=20
deal ""would be a humiliating setback for the governor,"" S&P said.
?????The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's=20
transmission grid to the state for $2.76 billion and the sale of $2 billion=
=20
in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt.=20
Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to=
=20
the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power.
?????Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators=
=20
have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a=20
desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicl=
y=20
that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not=
=20
be such a dire outcome.
?????But a senior Edison executive said it is ""way too early"" to give up on=
=20
passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official fo=
rm.
?????""There is an education process to do here,"" the executive said of the=
=20
highly detailed 38-page document. ""The legislators should be asking=20
questions. That is appropriate.""
?????* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether=20
alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding=
=20
supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dolla=
rs.
?????The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by=20
lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts wit=
h=20
the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal=20
energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.
?????""The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long,=
=20
hot days of summer,"" Wood said.
?????Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC=20
needs to address the $700 million the producers are owed. ""All we have gott=

is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,"" he said.
?????* An $850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious=20
megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by=

state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.
?????Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking=
=20
$242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to=20

?????But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning=
,=20
said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy=20
protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.
?????Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's=20
decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could=20

?????PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the=

Although lawmakers are skeptical of the state's multibillion-dollar deal to=
=20
acquire the power lines of Southern California Edison, the head of the=20
utility's parent company warned yesterday that failure to approve the accor=
d=20
could lead to a ""long and costly"" bankruptcy.=20
But John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, told The Chronicl=
e=20
that he thought legislators would ""want to do the right thing"" by approving=
=20
the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court.=20
Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe=20
consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the=20
state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity=20
rates.=20
Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least=
=20
not in its present form.=20
""We are going to go through this thing extensively,"" said state Senate=20
President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. ""There are a lot of concern=
s=20
about the valuation.""=20
Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long=
=20
as Edison is open to amending some of the terms.=20
""The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going t=
o=20
have its say,"" Burton said.=20
Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain=20
amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach=20
common ground with lawmakers.=20
""The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,""=
=20
said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. ""There will be a big effort to=
=20
try and work something out.""=20
Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his compan=
y=20
as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith.=
=20
This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned=
=20
acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing.=
=20
Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations.=20
""We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for=
=20
the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that=20
would allow us to get on with operating our power system,"" Bryson said.=20
Bankruptcy, he said, ""is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly=
=20
process.""=20
It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating=20
agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in=
=20
warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the=20
state's energy mess.=20
""The state may be forced to issue junk bonds,"" said Carol Coale, an energy-=
=20
industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. ""This could lead to =
a=20
surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds.""=20
Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as =
a=20
prudent alternative to bankruptcy.=20
""This is a very good deal for the state,"" he said. ""It is not a bailout.=20
Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible.""=20
Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8=
=20
billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and=
=20
drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past=
=20
debt.=20
Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission syst=
em=20
-- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little=
=20
use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired.=20
""It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,"" said Doug Heller,=
 a=20
spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa=20
Monica. ""Edison gets off scot-free.""=20
Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount pa=
id=20
for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission in regulating the utility.=20
They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the stat=
e=20
if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power=20
grid.=20
""The deal on the table is still salvageable,"" said Michael Shames, executiv=
e=20
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ""But Edison=
=20
needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework,=
=20
not set in stone.""=20
For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take=
=20
on the issue.=20

notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the=

But that's where the similarities end.=20
Differences=20
The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an=20
assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because=

a statement on the governor's Web site.=20
Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 3=

percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'.=20
The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from=20
consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential=20
increase of 7.5 percent.=20
TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up=
=20
for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law.=20
PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residentia=
l=20
users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through highe=
r=20
rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average=
=20
rate increase of nearly 30 percent.=20
``The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,'' sa=

Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN.=20
Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for=20
electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved.=20
Utilities want surcharge=20
Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive.=
=20
Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that=20

Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of=

time -- in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a=

``It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,'' said Paul=20

All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem:=20
California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the=

The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money=

the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures.=20

The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns=

""Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and=

While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to=

The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, =

But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says=

Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory=

associated with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop=

generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said.=20
And it is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take=

""We're close because summer is approaching,'' Commissioner Linda Breathitt=

said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls=

End To Deregulation of Nevada Power



CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Gov. Kenny Guinn signed a bill
Wednesday that would stop the sale of Nevada power plants, halt
deregulation and bail out struggling utilities with a new rate
system.


The Senate and Assembly gave the measure final approval earlier
in the day and rushed it to the governor. The bill was crafted to
keep Nevada from suffering from a power crisis similar to
California's.


``I must tell you this is a great relief,'' said Guinn, a former
utility executive, as he signed the bill into law. ``Nothing can
control escalating costs, but we're in the best position to protect
ourselves.''


Legislators made a last-minute change to add language that
ensured consumers would get a break on rates if utilities profit
from sales of excess power to other states.


Guinn said the bill takes care of the most pressing energy
issues, but other deregulation-related bills are sure to follow.
That includes a plan that would allow major power users, such as
casinos and mines, to buy power on the open market.


Legislators also are working on plans encouraging energy
conservation and ensuring the poor can pay their utility bills.

PG&E Co. Issues Statements On the Increase in the State's Cost for Power



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 18, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -

FROM:   John Nelson, Director of the News Department Pacific Gas and


Electric Company


There seems to have been some confusion yesterday over the effect
Pacific Gas and Electric Company's bankruptcy filing may have had on
energy prices. I thought it might be helpful to provide a few useful
facts and figures, to help you pin down the truth behind what may be
driving the state's energy costs higher.


Yesterday, Governor Davis claimed that the state was paying
roughly $20 million more for electricity every day as a direct result
of the bankruptcy filing by PG&amp;E. While it's understandable, even
laudable, that the Governor would want to fully explain the downsides
of utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not accurate. The Governor
should know better.


Consider the facts:


--  On January 19, the credit ratings of California's two largest


investor-owned utilities -- PG&amp;E and SCE -- were downgraded to


below investment grade by every major rating agency.


Generators immediately raised concerns about continuing to


sell power to such non-creditworthy entities.


--  The state reacted by passing AB7x, which authorized the state


Department of Water Resources to make $400 million in power


purchases. Less than two weeks later, on February 1, the


Governor signed AB1x, which authorized DWR to buy power on an


ongoing basis at least through 2002, until the utilities could


be restored to creditworthiness. The clear understanding in


the legislative debate was that the DWR would purchase the


full ""net open position"", which is the amount of additional


generation needed, beyond what the utilities themselves own or


have under contract, to meet customer demand.


However, a few weeks later, in spite of the clear intent of


state law, it was revealed that DWR was not buying the full


net open position, and had no intention of doing so. It was


only buying power that it considered ""reasonably priced"" and


was leaving the ISO to buy whatever was necessary to keep the


lights on -- an amount that most estimates place at 10- to


20-percent of the state's daily electricity need.


--  The ISO, in turn, revealed its intention to attempt to pass


along the costs of these last-minute, high-cost, spot-market


purchases to the state's non-creditworthy utilities (despite


existing FERC tariffs which precluded the ISO from doing so).


PG&amp;E has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly


$10 million a day; SCE has a similar estimate. (We don't know


for sure, because we haven't seen the bill. The DWR won't say


how much power it's buying, and at what cost, and neither will


the ISO.)


--  On February 14, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission


informed the Independent System Operator that it could not


force generators to sell to non-creditworthy entities (namely,


both PG&amp;E and SCE). This order appeared to force the DWR to


purchase the full net open after all. The ISO responded the


next day with its own interpretation of the FERC order, saying


the order was limited to ""emergency"" power only. The ISO also


sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining


order (issued by Judge Damrell), forcing generators to


continue selling to it.


--  On February 22, five power generators filed a complaint with


FERC seeking to clarify that the ISO's interpretation of the


February 14 order was contrary to FERC's intent.


--  On April 5, the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Judge


Damrell's lower court order affecting one of the generators,


Reliant, saying the generator was no longer required to sell


electricity to the ISO without assurances of payment.


Presumably this order would apply to other generators, if they


sought such assurances.


--  On April 6, PG&amp;E noted in the announcement of its Chapter 11


filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the


""financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy


procurement costs"" caused by the state's failure to assume the


full procurement responsibility.


--  On April 6, unrelated to PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing, FERC issued


an order responding to the generators' Feb. 22 complaint


against the ISO. In this new order, FERC reaffirmed its


February 14 order that the ISO could only buy power on behalf


of creditworthy entities, meaning neither PG&amp;E nor SCE.


--  On April 9 in remarks reported in the press, the Governor's


office acknowledged the State's ""bill for energy purchases


will increase by upward of $8 million a day after a ruling


last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,"" once


DWR started buying the full net open position, rather than


force the ISO to try to bill the utilities. It seems likely


that the $8 million was an estimate based on only one of the


utilities' costs, not the combination of both.


--  On April 11, the ISO discontinued its daily practice of


publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before.


--  Despite the history, the state continues to try to avoid


buying the full net open position. On April 13, in response to


the FERC order -- NOT the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing -- the ISO


sent a ""murky"" notice to generators promising that ""any bid


accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial


support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this


notice."" Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the


assurances contained in the letter.


--  Yesterday, in response to the Governor's claim that bankruptcy


was driving up the state's costs, Gary Ackerman, spokesman for


the Western Power Trading Forum, said ""I don't believe, nor


have I ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to


the cost of power.... If anything, I think that generators and


marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings


order to an otherwise volatile situation.""


What does it all mean? Clearly, the increase in the state's costs
have come as a result of the DWR finally covering the state's energy
needs, as promised in AB1x. This change in DWR's buying habits has
come as a direct result of the February 14 and April 6 FERC orders
that the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities. These orders were
issued independent of PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing and apply equally to
PG&amp;E and SCE.


Neither PG&amp;E nor SCE have been creditworthy since mid-January,
when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, and
the DWR, ISO and Governor's office have been aware of the effect of
the FERC order since mid-February.


Some generators have suggested that California has been paying a
credit penalty since December, when the utilities' deteriorating
financial situation gave rise to payment concerns. There appears to be
far more evidence that the state's coy approach to AB1x implementation
has created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PG&amp;E's
Chapter 11 filing.

J.D. Power and Associates Reports/ Nationwide Decline in Customer=20
Satisfaction of Electric Utility Service Among Midsize Businesses




Price and Value Performance Hit Hard Across Nation;


Satisfaction in California Continues to Plummet


AGOURA HILLS, Calif., April 19 /PRNewswire/ -- Midsize business customers,
who are responsible for approximately fifteen percent of the nation's
electricity consumption, are very critical of electricity prices, according=
 to
the J.D. Power and Associates 2001 Electric Utility Midsize Business Custom=
er
Satisfaction Study(SM) released today.  Consequently, the study's nationwid=
e
customer satisfaction index fell -- from 100 points in 2000 to 97 in 2001.


(Photo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010419/LATH066-a


http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010419/LATH066-b

http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010419/LATH066-e )


""The entire country was affected by higher natural gas prices this winter,
and with more states re-evaluating deregulation, midsize business customers
are especially sensitive to electricity prices,"" said Jeffrey Conklin, seni=
or
director at J.D. Power and Associates.


The 2001 study shows that average overall customer satisfaction with
California's ""big three"" investor-owned utilities -- Pacific Gas and Electr=
ic,
San Diego Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison -- fell an
astonishing 14 index points among midsize businesses compared to the
2000 study.


""In California, electric utility satisfaction among midsize business
customers has virtually fallen into the Pacific,"" said Alan Destribats,
executive director of the utility practice at J.D. Power and Associates.


The study finds that the chief determinants of satisfaction among electric
utility midsize customers are a provider's company image, price and value, =
and
power quality and reliability.


As expected, midsize business customers were extremely critical of
performance in the areas of company image and price and value.  Even outsid=
e
of California, satisfaction in the price and value component fell more than
any other factor -- from an index score of 100 in 2000 to 93 in 2001.


Power Quality and Reliability


Utility performance in power quality and reliability is improving, with
the national index increasing by 3 points.  Although the number of
interruptions and outages experienced was relatively the same in 2001 as it
was in 2000, midsize businesses report much shorter outage durations, falli=
ng
from an average of seven hours for the longest outages in 2000 to four hour=
s
in 2001.


Retail Competition


""Opening utility markets to competition has proven to be a difficult
process and, so far, midsize business customers are giving the industry poo=
r
marks,"" said Destribats.


The study shows that midsize business customers located in states with
competition not only are less satisfied than are customers in other states,
but they are also significantly less satisfied now than last year.  The stu=
dy
also shows that more midsize businesses have switched electricity providers=
.
Of midsize businesses eligible to switch power suppliers, 9 percent have do=
ne
so, up from 5 percent in 2000.


J.D. Power and Associates interviewed representatives from more than
7,200 midsize businesses, including manufacturers, retailers, business and
consumer services firms, health care providers and other midsize businesses
throughout the United States.  Midsize business owners are defined as those
who normally spend $1,500 to $25,000 per month on electricity.  The study
shows that midsize businesses are now spending an average of $4,827 per mon=
th
on electricity.


The study shows that utilities in the south region of the United States
consistently receive higher ratings across all factors of customer
satisfaction.  Likewise, these midsize business customers also report the
lowest levels of monthly electricity expenditures, on average.  Midsize
businesses in North Carolina spend the least for electric usage ($3,885 per
month on average), while those in New Hampshire, Nevada and Utah spend the
most ($5,700 to $5,800 per month on average).  The study also shows that
midsize businesses in Alabama and Florida report the most service
interruptions and outages within the past 12 months, and those in Washingto=
n
report the fewest.


East Region


PPL Utilities, serving east Pennsylvania, ranks highest in overall
customer satisfaction with midsize businesses in the eastern United States.
PPL Utilities ranked highest in the East Region in four of the six factors
that comprise customer satisfaction, with its primary strength in price and
value.  Other solid performers in this region include Public Service Electr=
ic
and Gas, Allegheny Power and GPU Energy.


Midwest Region


LG&amp;E Energy, the parent company of Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Ga=
s
and Electric, ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction with midsize
business electric service in the Midwest.  LG&amp;E Energy midsize business
customers give high ratings for power quality and reliability, customer
service, and billing and payment.  Alliant Energy, AEP-Midwest and Xcel
Energy-NSP also rank high in midsize business customer satisfaction in the
Midwest Region.


South Region


Southern Company ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction for
midsize business electric service in the South Region and received the high=
est
customer satisfaction index score among all utilities included in the study=
.
Southern Company dominates all other electric utility service providers,
achieving the highest ratings in the nation in five of the six components
(2 in a tie).  Other strong performers in the South Region include Duke Pow=

		 Subject: Economics Study on Proposed Houston SIP--Preliminary Results

You might mark your calendar for a lunch (12-1:30) at the Hyatt downtown on 
Wednesday December 13 where Barton Smith of UH and George Tolley of the U. of 
Chicago will present the findings of their economic study.  The Houston Forum 
event will be part of the Kenneth L. Lay Lecture Series in Global Economics 
at the University of Houston.  (I will have a table for Enron.)

The authors presented their preliminary results to us this week, and the 
total benefits of the planned ozone reduction (all SIP measures as currently 
proposed) are below $100 million (we are indoors most of the time that bad 
air days are occurring since it is typically very hot), and the costs are 
around $5 billion out to 2010.   Lots of caveats to this conclusion including 
the assumption of today's best technology but no more.  The high costs 
include a ""last mile"" problem that the proposal of the Partnership's Business 
Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) avoids (such as no noon-to-midnight 
construction, a 75% average point source reduction to allow for trading and 
future permits instead of a 90% reduction, etc.).

The effect on Houston is to reduce our forecast economic growth but not 
eliminate it.  Real wages are forecast to fall by some 5% or more under the 
current SIP versus without it.  Total job loss will be over 100,000--about a 
1 and a half years of growth out to 2010.   This ""shock"" will be around 
one-half of what Houston went through after the oil price crash in 1986 
according to Dr. Smith.  One might say that slower growth and spreading the 
pollution around (some of our refinery/petrochemical growth going elsewhere) 
is not the end of the world, however, if a more cost-effective SIP is chosen.

It will be several weeks before the results are final (and the election 
over), at which time an executive summary will be released.  The Mayor's 
office and TNRCC will be briefed first.  The luncheon will be the formal 
unveiling of the study with explanation, but I expect press coverage of the 
study next month.

As head of the economics working group, I have tried to ensure that a 
top-notch analysis was done without an industry bias.  The results are 
considered conservative by the authors all things considered and in line with 
the peer-reviewed literature on costs and benefits.  The study is not 
intended to be a ""whining"" study but to give us realistic expectations and to 
(naturally) bring into review some ""last mile"" problems where certain SIP 
measures are the least cost effective.

These preliminary results are confidential given the political cycle we are 
in and should not be shared externally.

Dear Dr. Kaminski

here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow

Dr. V. Kaminski
Enron
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001





I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.



Sincerely


W. Fitzgibbon

Dave, since the ENA power desk will be receiving 100% of all earnings related 
to the City of Austin capacity, it's only appropriate that any cost overruns 
will be sent directly to their P/L. There isn't anything that leads me to 
believe there will be overruns, but you know how that goes with NEPCO and I 
want to be very clear up front that if something should occur, I have no 
ability to offset the cost with other Austin earnings. 

I'd also like to set aside some time when we can talk thru several business 
items/issues. The teaser list is as follows:  continuing internal noise 
between the desks and origination groups related to deals and primarily the 
P/L split (any maybe a few solutions), the followup and status and 
recommendations on the global LNG business and ENA's interest (I've had 
meetings with Doug Rotenburg, Vince Kiminski, others, and new info from our 
Duke meeting), status of Chicago office, clarification on leftover items from 
Columbia acquisition last year, employee hiring/contracts,  etc.

Maybe we can get together this afternoon or tomorrow. How about the status of 
the FP&L meeting with Jim Broadhead?

Hey guys. I would like an outline of the City of Austin project as far as how 
this will be managed from ENA's standpoint. My understanding is that Jeff 
Keenan will be the Project Manager for ENA and will be entirely responsible 
for the implementation of all aspects to bring the plant to commercial 
operations. This would include schedule, permitting, interconnect agreements, 
managing NEPCO to the $88.3 million total cost, etc. Everyone needs to 
realize that this team will realize a true loss on any overruns above the 
$88.3 million. I've asked Tammy Shepherd to set up a budget, schedule and 
weekly distribution similarly to how we handled Doyle and the other projects. 
I'm assuming that this team is managing everything related to the Austin 
project and is accountable for its successful implementation. 

If we need to discuss anything related to the above, let me know.  Thanks.

Subject: Invitation - Wharton ET Events


Vince hello,

I just wanted to followup up on our meeting at Wharton and let you know
that there are two upcoming events that you may want to attend - or
designate others from Enron to attend.  Both of these events are good
opportunities to ""test drive"" the Emerging Technologies program and see if
there is an interest in joining our partner group.

SEPTEMBER 8 - WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET?

Our next insight-building event will be held at Wharton on Friday,
September 8 and is entitled ""What Next On the Internet?""

This is primarily a Wharton faculty event and we will be exploring 3 areas:
1) the New Economics on the Web, 2) Internet, Anywhere, and 3)
Implications for (academic) Research and Education.  Speakers will include
Jay Walker (Priceline.com), David Farber (Chief Technologist at the FCC)
and Mohan Sawhney (Kellog Univ., one of the nation's thought leaders on
e-Commerce), along with several senior Wharton faculty members.

There will be considerable discussion on how the next generation of the
Internet will evolve and the implications for management and management
research.  We are inviting our industry partners to join us at this event,
and participate in the discussion, which should contain some valuable
insights and also provides an opportunity to help set our research agenda.
You are most welcome to participate, or designate a colleague, if you like.

OCTOBER 19&20 - WINNERS & LOSERS IN THE E-COMMERCE SHAKEOUT

This will be a major Impact Conference to explore the coming Internet
shakeout, and apply some of the traditional shakeout measures to E-Commerce
and try to determine what we can expect.  It should be an intriguing day.
If you plan to attend please RSVP early since we are sure to be
""overbooked"" for this event.  This is probably the best showcase for our
insight-building activities, if you would like to invite any colleagues
help determine if it makes sense for Enron to become a partner in the ET
Program.

If you'd like to RSVP for you and any colleagues who would like to attend
one or both of the events described above,  send me an email reply and I'll
send you a more detailed agenda and speaker description, etc.

I'll be on vacation the rest of this week but if you have any questions or
comments you can call or email me next week.

best regards,
Michael

Errol,

Yet another deal in which C/P claims deal should have been NYMEX rather than 
Gas Daily.  Can you adjust in TAGG?

Thanks,
Joe

Subject: Cement- a new business opportunity?

Jeff:

CALME's HR advised me that there is no match for my skills and experience in 
your business unit.  I spent a great part of my professional career in the 
oil & gas business.  Therefore, I have contacted Mike Brown to see if I can 
bring value to his team.  I have not gotten any response yet.

As I have about three weeks left to find a position within Enron, I would 
like to explore/seek origination opportunities in a totally new area for 
Enron:  Cement.  This industry can be transformed to the new economy and 
given its size, it may well be a significant income generating market for us 
and certainly within a short time another commodity for EnronOnline.

This is new for me but enormously challenging.  I am asking you to give me a 
chance to sell this concept to you at your convenience.  I have enclosed a 
brief resume for your review.

I look forward to meeting with you.  Thanks, Jeff

Linda & Sharon,

My primary job responsibility is to online trading, and right now EnronOnline 
is quite a beast of a customer.  Because of that I please ask that you direct 
any future questions you may have with respect to confirmations to our two 
paralegals who handle the day to day trading, Susan Bailey at x34737 and 
Stephanie Panus at x53249.  

With respect to the two current Canadian confirmations, Sara Shackleton, an 
attorney in our Group, is working with Credit to resolve the questions on the 
Slater Steel and Casco credit worksheets.",Questions regarding Confirmations

one of the organizations that 
receives much of its funding from the United Way.  I was surprised to find 
out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused  
Houston children and  the caring adults who will open their homes as foster 
parents.  I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to 
the center.  Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchin 
and meeting four year-old Jessica and ten year-old Steven who were 
temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to 
have made that pledge.  

Enron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive 
matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit 
organizations.  Hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your 
charitable giving during the year.  The United Way campaign is the one time 
each year that Enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a 
difference in the lives of so many in Houston.  Each dollar pledged by an 
employee is matched by Enron.  

If you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing 
so as soon as possible.  Our United Way campaign draws to its conclusion next 
Wednesday, August 23.  I hope that each one of you will consider making a 
pledge.  There is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all Enron 
employees can make a significant positive impact for Houston.  Log on to 
http://unitedway.enron.com to complete your pledge card.

Thanks to the many of you who have already completed your electronic 
pledge.    ",Message from Sally Beck

USA: Senators renew high-speed Internet tax credit bill. 
  
01/23/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A bill that would encourage businesses to 
bring high-speed Internet access to underserved areas was reintroduced in the 
Senate on Tuesday, with the hopes that President Bush would include the item 
in his budget.
Computers equipped with a ""broadband"" or high-speed Internet connection can 
download information at a rate of up to 1.5 megabits per second, or about 25 
times faster than a standard, dial-up connection. While broadband access is 
currently available in many business districts and affluent residential 
neighborhoods, the service has not yet spread to less affluent or more 
sparsely populated areas. 
The bill would provide a five-year, 10 percent tax credit to Internet 
companies that extend broadband service to rural or underserved urban areas.
Companies who build ""next generation"" networks, with download speeds of up to 
22 megabits per second, would receive a 20 percent, five-year credit.
The bill was introduced by Republican senators Olympia Snowe of Maine and 
Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Democrats Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and John 
Kerry of Massachusetts. It was co-sponsored by 32 other senators.
The 36 senators sent a letter to President Bush urging him to include the 
bill in his initial budget proposal.
The bill attracted the support of 59 senators and 115 House members last 
year, the letter claimed.

I'm not sure that what I told you to do in the CSA Annex with respect to 
Custodians and their qualifications work so for now let's keep it out and go 
back to our old language.

Sara and Mark:
Shari had a counterparty point out to her that in our CSA Annex language 
where we talk about the circumstances under which a party can ""hold"" 
collateral, all of our triggers are based on something happening to our 
counterparty and nothing is said about what would happen if a Custodian holds 
the colateral and fails to be creditworthy.  Do you have any thoughts on 
this?  At first I thought that we should require the Custodian to be a 
Qualified institution but I'm not sure that that is the right approach.  Let 
me know what you think.
